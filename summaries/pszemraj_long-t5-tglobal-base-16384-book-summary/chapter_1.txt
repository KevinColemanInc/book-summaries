The narrator tells us that Holmes always seems to be in love with Irene, even though he's never spoken of her as a woman. He doesn't say anything about the "softer passions," which are great for drawing out the veil of men's actions and motives. But there's only one woman in Holmes's life who is really interested in him: the late Isabella Adler. Watson hasn't seen Holmes lately, because his marriage has drifted away from him. Still, he wants to see him. One night, on March 20, 1888, Watson runs into Holmes in his study. He asks how he knows that Watson has put on seven pounds since he saw him. Holmes admits that he didn't tell him what he was going to do; he also says that Mary Jane is incorigible. Holmes then gives Watson a note from a gentleman who wants to consult him about something important. It's not written in English, but Holmes says it's "peculiar".
The narrator tells Holmes that the note he has received is from a German man who wears a black mask. He asks Holmes to help him find out what the man wants, and when Holmes agrees, he leaves. A large man enters with a heavy coat, cloak, and hat. His face is covered in flame-colored silk and fur. He wears an elaborate black mask which he adjusts as he enters. When Holmes asks whom he should speak to, the man replies that he is the Count von Kramm, Bohemians nobleman. Holmes promises to keep the matter a secret for two years, but warns that it might have an impact on European history. Holmes says he was aware of the matter, but cannot explain why he would try to conceal it. After describing Irene's background, Holmes notes that she was born in New Jersey during the 1858-1858 period. She had been exiled from the operatic stage in London, and now wishes to get her letters back.
The narrator asks Holmes about Irene's secret marriage. Holmes tells him that she has forgeried her letters and photographs, but that she will not sell them because she is about to marry a second daughter of King Lear. He also tells Holmes that he would give one province of his kingdom to have the photograph. At three in the morning, Holmes arrives at the Adler house. He finds a drunk groom who laughs heartily at him. When he returns, he discovers that the groom left the house early in the day and went to Briony lodge, a large, well-furnished villa with a passage window on the side. He spends the rest of the day listening to all the gossip from the neighborhood. He then decides to go back to London to investigate the matter.
The narrator tells Watson that he is following him closely when a man rushes into the house and asks for a ride to the church. When he gets there, he finds two other men in the church waiting for him. The clergyman refuses to marry Irene because of his license, and so he looks like a fool trying to get her to marry him. After the wedding, the couple leaves the church and goes off to make their own arrangements. Watson asks Holmes what he wants from him, and he says he needs his help. He gives him a smokerocket and instructs him to throw it into the room and then to raise a "cry of fire" outside the window.
The narrator tells us that Holmes and Watson are on their way to find the woman's photograph. They arrive just as the lady is about to leave her carriage. A fight breaks out, and Holmes falls to the ground with blood running from his face. He is carried into the principal room of the house. Doctor Holmes sits up on the couch and a maid rushes in and throws a smokerocket into the room. Everyone starts shouting "Fire," and everyone leaves except for Doctor Holmes who knows where the photograph is. When he asks how Holmes found the photograph, Holmes says that he had a red paint in his hand when the row started. He then fell down and clapted his hand to his face, making it look like he has been tricked. Dr. Holmes also tells him that women often think that their houses are on fire, so they rush to the things that they value most.
The next morning, Holmes and Watson go to Briony-Lodge to find Irene. They discover that she is married to Norton, but she could not marry him because she was afraid of what would happen if she did not love the King. Holmes finds a photograph with a letter addressed to him, which he immediately leaves in case the King should want it. The letter says that Holmes took him in when the fire alarm was heard, and that he now knows how he betrayed himself. He keeps the photograph only to protect himself from any future steps that the King might take. The King thanks Holmes for his part in the crime and gives him a ring as a token of gratitude.
