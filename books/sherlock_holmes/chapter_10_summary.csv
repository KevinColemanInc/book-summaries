Sherlock Homes,10,1,"['The Lord St. Simonmarriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject ofinterest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn thegossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe,however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public,and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing thematter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some littlesketch of this remarkable episode. It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was stillsharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoonstroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoorsall day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnalwinds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as arelic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in oneeasy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud ofnewspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them allaside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelopeupon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondentcould be. “Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered.“Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and atide-waiter.” “Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” heanswered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a maneither to be bored or to lie.” He broke the seal and glanced over the contents. “Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.” “Not social, then?” “No, distinctly professional.” “And from a noble client?” “One of the highest in England.” “My dear fellow, I congratulate you.” “I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my clientis a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is justpossible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation.You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?” “It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle inthe corner. “I have had nothing else to do.” “It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I readnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is alwaysinstructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must haveread about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?” “Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.” “That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon.I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let mehave whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:']",2921,"The narrator recounts the scandalous termination of Lord St. Simon's marriage. After years out of the spotlight, the event has reemerged due to the involvement of Sherlock Holmes in resolving the matter. The story is told from Dr. Watson's perspective during the time he was still living with Holmes. He receives a letter from a noble correspondent which is revealed to be Lord St. Simon. Holmes believes the letter could lead to a new investigation. He asks Watson, who has been keeping up with recent events through reading papers, about Lord St. Simon's wedding, which Watson admits to having deep interest in. Holmes asks Watson to turn over any paperwork related to the matter after reading Lord St. Simon's letter aloud.",726

I havedetermined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to thevery painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr.Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures methat he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that itmight be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in theafternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope thatyou will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yoursfaithfully, “‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’ “It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and thenoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side ofhis right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle. “He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in anhour.” “Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon thesubject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order oftime, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked ared-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece.“Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon hisknee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second sonof the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops inchief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years ofage, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in alate administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary forForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor onthe distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. Ithink that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.” “I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I,“for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable.I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry onhand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.” “Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from thefirst. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.” “Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal columnof the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘Amarriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour iscorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son ofthe Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of AloysiusDoran.

One by one the management of the noble housesof Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across theAtlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the listof the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St.Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the littlegod’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage withMiss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. MissDoran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at theWestbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported thather dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies forthe future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has beencompelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simonhas no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obviousthat the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which willenable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to aBritish peeress.’” “Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning. “Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Postto say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be atSt. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friendswould be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house atLancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two dayslater—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement thatthe wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at LordBackwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices whichappeared before the disappearance of the bride.” “Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start. “The vanishing of the lady.” “When did she vanish, then?” “At the wedding breakfast.” “Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic,in fact.” “Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.” “They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during thehoneymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray letme have the details.” “I warn you that they are very incomplete.” “Perhaps we may make them less so.” “Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morningpaper of yesterday, which I will read to you.

In spite of the attempts of the friends to hushthe matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no goodpurpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject forconversation. “‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s,Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father ofthe bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, LordEustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of thebridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwardsto the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had beenprepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose namehas not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house afterthe bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It wasonly after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler andthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before thisunpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when shecomplained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolongedabsence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned fromher maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up anulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declaredthat he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused tocredit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. Onascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, inconjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication withthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probablyresult in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a latehour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of themissing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said thatthe police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the originaldisturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she mayhave been concerned in the strange disappearance of thebride.’” “And is that all?” “Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is asuggestive one.” “And it is—” “That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, hasactually been arrested.

The woman was forcibly ejected from the premises. Meanwhile, the bride complained of feeling unwell and went to her room, but was soon discovered to have left the house entirely. The missing bride's father and groom immediately contacted the police, but the bride's whereabouts remain unknown.

Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer havinga witness, if only as a check to my own memory.” “Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open thedoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale,with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady,well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and tobe obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undueimpression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of theknees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat,was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it wascareful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, whitewaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.

This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.” “A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have alreadymanaged several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that theywere hardly from the same class of society.” “No, I am descending.” “I beg pardon.” “My last client of the sort was a king.” “Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?” “The King of Scandinavia.” “What! Had he lost his wife?” “You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend tothe affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you inyours.” “Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to myown case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you informing an opinion.” “Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, forexample, as to the disappearance of the bride.” Lord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as itgoes.” “But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer anopinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioningyou.” “Pray do so.” “When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?” “In San Francisco, a year ago.” “You were travelling in the States?” “Yes.” “Did you become engaged then?” “No.” “But you were on a friendly footing?” “I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.” “Her father is very rich?” “He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”']",2896,"Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are visited by Lord Robert St. Simon, a gentleman of rank and prestige.

Then he struck gold, investedit, and came up by leaps and bounds.” “Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—yourwife’s character?” The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.“You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty beforeher father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining campand wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come fromNature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England atomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort oftraditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swiftin making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On theother hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour tobear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thoughther to be at bottom a noble woman.

It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature,and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, thelarge dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly atit. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon. “The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed youracquaintance?” “Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met herseveral times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.” “She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?” “A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.” “And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a faitaccompli?” “I really have made no inquiries on the subject.” “Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before thewedding?” “Yes.” “Was she in good spirits?” “Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our futurelives.” “Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of thewedding?” “She was as bright as possible—at least until after theceremony.” “And did you observe any change in her then?” “Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seenthat her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivialto relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.” “Pray let us have it, for all that.” “Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards thevestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into thepew.

I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think thatwe are wandering rather far from the point.” “Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frameof mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering herfather’s house?” “I saw her in conversation with her maid.” “And who is her maid?” “Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California withher.” “A confidential servant?” “A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her totake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these thingsin a different way.” “How long did she speak to this Alice?” “Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.” “You did not overhear what they said?” “Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ Shewas accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.” “American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife dowhen she finished speaking to her maid?” “She walked into the breakfast-room.” “On your arm?” “No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered somewords of apology, and left the room. She never came back.” “But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to herroom, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, andwent out.” “Quite so.

She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated herungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you knowwhat women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedinglyhot-headed and devotedly attached to me.

But you do not yourself look upon this aslikely?” “I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.” “Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what isyour own theory as to what took place?” “Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have givenyou all the facts.

As to the note, itis important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate youagain.” “I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “Ibelieve in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matterfirst.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and madefor the door. “Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rivalvanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any suchperson.” Lestrade looked sadly at my companion.

This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he hadbrought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quiteepicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-housemahogany.

The note, signed ""F.H.M,"" appears to confirm Lestrade's theory. However, Sherlock pays more attention to another side of the note - a seemingly unremarkable hotel bill. Sherlock believes both the note and the hotel bill hold significance. Despite Lestrade's skepticism, Sherlock insists on his theory and eventually dismisses Lady St. Simon as a myth, leaving Lestrade perplexed.

Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made methink that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions. “They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands. “You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.” “Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he.“I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancythat I hear his step now upon the stairs.” It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling hisglasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression uponhis aristocratic features. “My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes. “Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Haveyou good authority for what you say?” “The best possible.” Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead. “What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears thatone of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?” “It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is anyhumiliation.” “Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.” “I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the ladycould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it wasundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her atsuch a crisis.” “It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon,tapping his fingers upon the table. “You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented aposition.” “I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have beenshamefully used.” “I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there aresteps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of thematter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be moresuccessful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.“Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr.and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.” At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stoodvery erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of hisfrock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick stepforward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise hiseyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was onewhich it was hard to resist. “You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess youhave every cause to be.” “Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly. “Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should havespoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when']",2886,"The protagonist anticipates company through the preparation of supper that is laid out for five people.

For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rightsof it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharpface and alert manner. “Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady.“Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near theRockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank andI; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poorFrank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grewthe poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagementlasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’tthrow up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Paknowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we justfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile,too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then Ipromised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marryanyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married rightaway, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and Iwon’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talkedit over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready inwaiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek hisfortune, and I went back to Pa. “The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he wentprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After thatcame a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked byApache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed. I fainteddead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline andtook me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not a word of news came for ayear and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead.

I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he wasstill, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glador sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything wasturning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a beein my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make ascene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I wasthinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then Isaw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note.As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and heslipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only aline asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course Inever doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determinedto do just whatever he might direct. “When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and hadalways been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few thingspacked and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon,but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I justmade up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn’t been at thetable ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of theroad. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out,put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or otherabout Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if hehad a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to getaway from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away wedrove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my truewedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among theApaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him upfor dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me atlast on the very morning of my second wedding.” “I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave thename and the church but not where the lady lived.” “Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all foropenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like tovanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to Pa,perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all thoselords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to comeback. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, sothat I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one couldfind them.

She saw Frank across the road, and followed him to new lodgings at Gordon Square, declaring this her true wedding after waiting years for him.

Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if Ihave given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.” Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listenedwith a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative. “Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss mymost intimate personal affairs in this public manner.” “Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before Igo?” “Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out hishand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him. “I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joinedus in a friendly supper.” “I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded hisLordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, butI can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with yourpermission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us allin a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room. “Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,”said Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr.Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and theblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children frombeing some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shallbe a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.” “The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when ourvisitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simplethe explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almostinexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events asnarrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, forinstance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.” “You were not yourself at fault at all, then?” “From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the ladyhad been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she hadrepented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something hadoccurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What couldthat something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, forshe had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then?

Then who couldthis American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? Itmight be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, beenspent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before Iever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew,of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device forobtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to herconfidential maid, and of her very significant allusion toclaim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession ofthat which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation becameabsolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a loveror was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of thelatter.” “And how in the world did you find them?” “It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information inhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, ofcourse, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know thatwithin a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select Londonhotels.” “How did you deduce the select?” “By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for aglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not manyin London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited inNorthumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H.Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on lookingover the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen inthe duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; sothither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple athome, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to themthat it would be better in every way that they should make their position alittle clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep theappointment.” “But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct wascertainly not very gracious.” “Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not bevery gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, youfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune.

This deduction is based on subtle clues such as her behavior and her use of specific language associated with miners. With the help of unassuming information from the police and by tracking records in luxurious hotels, Holmes identifies the American as Francis H. Moulton and locates the couple. He urges them to clarify their situation to the public and the jilted groom, Lord St. Simon. The latter doesn't react well to this news, which Holmes attributes to the shock of losing a wife and a fortune suddenly.
