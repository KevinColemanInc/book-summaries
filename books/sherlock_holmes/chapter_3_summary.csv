Sherlock Homes,3,1,"['“My dearfellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in hislodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anythingwhich the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the thingswhich are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of thatwindow hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, andpeep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, theplannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working throughgenerations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make allfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale andunprofitable.” “And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The caseswhich come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgarenough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, andyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating norartistic.” “A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realisticeffect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report,where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate thanupon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the wholematter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as thecommonplace.” I smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinkingso,” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser andhelper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, youare brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. Buthere”—I picked up the morning paper from theground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the firstheading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is allperfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, thepush, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest ofwriters could invent nothing more crude.” “Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,”said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is theDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up somesmall points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was noother woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into thehabit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling themat his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to theimagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, andacknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.” He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre ofthe lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple lifethat I could not help commenting upon it.']",2902,"Sherlock Holmes and his companion are discussing reality versus fiction. Holmes believes reality to be stranger than anything the human mind can invent, arguing that it's full of unexpected occurrences and coincidences. His companion disagrees, suggesting that the cases reported in newspapers are typically mundane and lack artistic fascination. Holmes contends that the mundane reality isn't given the analysis it merits, and only seems commonplace due to superficial examination. He proves his point by discussing a domestic violence case, which defies conventional expectations. The husband is a teetotaler and there is no other woman involved, instead the husband bizarrely throws his false teeth at his wife after every meal. This winning argument leads Holmes to offer his snuff box as a sign of victory in their debate.",828
Sherlock Homes,3,2,"['that I could not help commenting upon it. “Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for someweeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for myassistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.” “And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant whichsparkled upon his finger. “It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which Iserved them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who havebeen good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.” “And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest. “Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. Theyare important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have foundthat it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for theobservation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives thecharm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for thebigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases,save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me fromMarseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It ispossible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutesare over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.” He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazingdown into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, Isaw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy furboa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hatwhich was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear.From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion atour windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingersfidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer wholeaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang ofthe bell. “I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing hiscigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means anaffaire de cœur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matteris not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate.When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, andthe usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is alove matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.” As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered toannounce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his smallblack figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. SherlockHolmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,']",2903,"The narrator, presumably Dr. Watson, speaks to Sherlock Holmes who shares that he received a souvenir from the King of Bohemia and a ring from the reigning family of Holland. Holmes then mentions that he has several cases on hand but none of great interest, apart from one referred to him from Marseilles. Holmes then notices a woman on the pavement, who seems to be in emotional distress. He concludes that her behaviour signifies a love affair complication. Just as he is analyzing her behaviour, the woman is announced as Miss Mary Sutherland.",546
Sherlock Homes,3,3,"['having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over inthe minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him. “Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it isa little trying to do so much typewriting?” “I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where theletters are without looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purportof his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear andastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve heardabout me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know allthat?” “Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business toknow things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not,why should you come to consult me?” “I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whosehusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up fordead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not rich,but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that Imake by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr.Hosmer Angel.” “Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” askedSherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling. Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss MarySutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said,“for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.Windibank—that is, my father—took it all. He would not go to thepolice, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing andkept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on withmy things and came right away to you.” “Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, sincethe name is different.” “Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, forhe is only five years and two months older than myself.” “And your mother is alive?” “Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr.Holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a manwho was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in theTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mothercarried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made hersell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. Theygot £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much asfather could have got if he had been alive.” I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling andinconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with thegreatest concentration of attention. “Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of thebusiness?” “Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned inAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five']",2893,"Sherlock Holmes calmly observes a woman named Miss Mary Sutherland who has short sight and does a lot of typewriting. She shares that in the beginning, her sight was a hindrance but now she can locate the letters without looking. She visits Holmes on a recommendation from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband Holmes had found when he was presumed dead. Sutherland wants Holmes to find Mr.Hosmer Angel, who has disappeared. She left her home to consult him, as her father (actually stepfather) refused to take any action or consult Holmes or the police about the disappearance. Her stepfather, being a wine traveller, is only five years older than she is. Though Holmes stereotypically does not enjoy inane conversation, the detective listens attentively to her life story, including her coming into an independent income from her uncle Ned in Auckland.",845

I believe that asingle lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.” “I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand thatas long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and sothey have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course,that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarterand pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what Iearn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do fromfifteen to twenty sheets in a day.” “You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes.“This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely asbefore myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. HosmerAngel.” A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously atthe fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he wasalive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr.Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He wouldget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But thistime I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? Hesaid the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends wereto be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purpleplush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, whennothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, butwe went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it wasthere I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.” “I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came backfrom France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.” “Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, andshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman,for she would have her way.” “I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, agentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.” “Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we hadgot home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes,I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr.Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.” “No?” “Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. Hewouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that awoman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say tomother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mineyet.”']",2910,"In the excerpt, a woman is telling Sherlock Holmes about her situation. While she earns her living by typing, she also receives an interest of a hundred pounds a year from her late father's investment. Living with her mother, she tries not to be a burden to her, but she also desires independence. She starts speaking about a man named Hosmer Angel whom she met at a gasfitters’ ball, and whom her father would not allow her to see. Not long after meeting Mr. Angel, her father returned from a trip to France and forbade her from meeting with him again, believing women should be content within their family circle. She expresses her dissatisfaction with this circulating notion and asserts her longing for her own social life. The conversation between the woman and Sherlock Holmes sets the stage for a potentially larger mystery or crime that Mr. Holmes may investigate.",874

Did he make no attempt to seeyou?” “Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wroteand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he hadgone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I tookthe letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.” “Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?” “Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took.Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in LeadenhallStreet—and—” “What office?” “That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.” “Where did he live, then?” “He slept on the premises.” “And you don’t know his address?” “No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.” “Where did you address your letters, then?” “To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. Hesaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the otherclerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, likehe did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote themthey seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt thatthe machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me,Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.” “It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been anaxiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can youremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?” “He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in theevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Veryretiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had thequinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left himwith a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He wasalways well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mineare, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.” “Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned toFrance?” “Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we shouldmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear,with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be trueto him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a signof his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonderof him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I beganto ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just totell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him.

Your wedding was arranged, then, for theFriday. Was it to be in church?” “Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, nearKing’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. PancrasHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put usboth into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be theonly other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when thefour-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and whenthe cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabmansaid that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him getin with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seenor heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.” “It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” saidHolmes. “Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all themorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and thateven if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always toremember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooneror later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happenedsince gives a meaning to it.” “Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseencatastrophe has occurred to him?” “Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would nothave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.” “But you have no notion as to what it could have been?” “None.” “One more question. How did your mother take the matter?” “She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matteragain.” “And your father? Did you tell him?” “Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, andthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone havein bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he hadborrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money andnever would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? Andwhy could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and Ican’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief outof her muff and began to sob heavily into it. “I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising,“and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.

And your address?” “No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.” “Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is yourfather’s place of business?” “He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers ofFenchurch Street.” “Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly.

She laid herlittle bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to comeagain whenever she might be summoned. Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressedtogether, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upwardto the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe,which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in hischair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look ofinfinite languor in his face. “Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “Ifound her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, israther a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, inAndover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague lastyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were newto me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.” “You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible tome,” I remarked. “Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, andso you missed all that was important.

Youhave really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everythingof importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye forcolour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourselfupon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man itis perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, thiswoman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showingtraces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist pressesagainst the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the handtype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of itfarthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, asthis was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez ateither side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting,which seemed to surprise her.” “It surprised me.” “But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested onglancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were notunlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightlydecorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the twolower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now,when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away fromhome with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that shecame away in a hurry.” “And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by myfriend’s incisive reasoning. “I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home butafter being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at theforefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger werestained with violet ink.

Absolutely noclue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is oneremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.” “They are typewritten,” I remarked. “Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but nosuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point aboutthe signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call itconclusive.” “Of what?” “My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears uponthe case?” “I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to denyhis signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.” “No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, whichshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to theyoung lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meetus here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that weshould do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothinguntil the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem uponthe shelf for the interim.” I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers ofreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have somesolid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated thesingular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I knownhim to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adlerphotograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four,and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I feltthat it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel. I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction thatwhen I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his handsall the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearingbridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

It was notuntil close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able tospring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be toolate to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found SherlockHolmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in therecesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, withthe pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent hisday in the chemical work which was so dear to him. “Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered. “Yes.

The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear,that can touch the scoundrel.” “Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting MissSutherland?” The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lipsto reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door. “This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” saidHolmes. “He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Comein!” The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years ofage, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and apair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioningglance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with aslight bow sidled down into the nearest chair. “Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I thinkthat this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment withme for six o’clock?” “Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my ownmaster, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about thislittle matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort inpublic. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a veryexcitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easilycontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mindyou so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is notpleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is auseless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?” “On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reasonto believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.” Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I amdelighted to hear it,” he said. “It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriterhas really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unlessthey are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get moreworn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this noteof yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring overof the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the moreobvious.” “We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and nodoubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly atHolmes with his bright little eyes. “And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another littlemonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is']",2927,"The speaker is upset about a mystery involving a man who abandoned a woman named Miss Sutherland. However, they believe no law can touch the man responsible. A man named Mr. James Windibank, Miss Sutherland's stepfather, arrives to speak with the speaker, who is later revealed to be the detective Sherlock Holmes. Windibank suggests that Holmes should not get involved in this family issue, expressing his concern about their reputation. The issue concerns the whereabouts of one Mr. Hosmer Angel. Holmes announces that he has reasons to believe that he will succeed in finding Hosmer Angel. Holmes also observes a correlation between the individuality of a typewriter's typing and a person's handwriting, stating it as a study of interest for solving crimes.",760
Sherlock Homes,3,11,"['a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here fourletters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten.In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use mymagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I havealluded are there as well.” Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannotwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said.“If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have doneit.” “Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in thedoor. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!” “What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips andglancing about him like a rat in a trap. “Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmessuavely. “There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It isquite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that itwas impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sitdown and let us talk it over.” Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter ofmoisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” hestammered. “I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank,it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever camebefore me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you willcontradict me if I go wrong.” The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, likeone who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of themantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking,rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us. “The man married a woman very much older than himself for hermoney,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of thedaughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for peoplein their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. Itwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiabledisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it wasevident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, shewould not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, ofcourse, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to preventit? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her toseek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that wouldnot answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finallyannounced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does herclever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his headthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguisedhimself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a']",2931,"The subject refers to four typewritten letters that supposedly come from a missing man. Mr. Windibank, who appears to be uninterested in the in-depth analysis, is impatient for results. Holmes shocks him by saying the culprit has been caught and is, in fact, Windibank himself. Shifting to a narrative style, Holmes recounts how Windibank, married to an older woman for her money, schemed to keep control of his stepdaughter's inheritance. Wanting to maintain control over the considerable sum, he tried to restrict his stepdaughter's social activities. But as she started showing signs of rebellion, Windibank disguised himself with the help of his wife to manipulate his stepdaughter's actions further.",704

However that may be, the young lady was very decidedlycarried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was inFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. Shewas flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increasedby the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if areal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, whichwould finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyoneelse. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeysto France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring thebusiness to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanentimpression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking uponany other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exactedupon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of somethinghappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished MissSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of afour-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr.Windibank!” Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had beentalking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face. “It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but ifyou are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you whoare breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from thefirst, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to anaction for assault and illegal constraint.” “The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking andthrowing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deservedpunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay awhip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at thesight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part ofmy duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think Ishall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip,but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,']",2902,"In the passage, a man using the alias Mr. Hosmer Angel uses cunning and manipulation to woo a young lady, with the underlying motive of keeping other suitors away. He tries to instill the idea in the girl's mind that he is in love with her and even gets engaged to her. His goal is to leave a significant imprint on her heart that would deter her from considering any other man for at least a decade. He carries out the charade to the church door on the wedding day, where he abruptly disappears. James Windibank attempts to confront the situation but ends up accusing Holmes of breaking the law. Holmes, however, expresses his disgust at the man's actions and threatens to use a hunting crop on him, implying physical punishment. He is halted by a commotion up the stairs.",773

Then the fact that the two men were never together, butthat the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So werethe tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiaraction in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that hishandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallestsample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,all pointed in the same direction.” “And how did you verify them?” “Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew thefirm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. Ieliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—thewhiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a requestthat they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any oftheir travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter,and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he wouldcome here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the sametrivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter fromWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the descriptiontallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilàtout!” “And Miss Sutherland?” “If I tell her she will not believe me.

Holmes predicts Windibank will continue escalating in his crimes. When questioned about his deductions, Holmes recaps his reasoning, pointing to various suspicious behaviors that hinted at Windibank's guilt in a certain incident. This included his masked identity, efforts to keep the two men apart, and an apparent connection with a certain firm. With these, Holmes was able to verify Windibank's identity and criminal actions. Lastly, speaking of Miss Sutherland, Holmes claims that revealing the truth to her may be as dangerous as taking a tiger cub, as she may not believe him.",663
