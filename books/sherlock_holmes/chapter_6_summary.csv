Sherlock Homes,6,1,"['Isa Whitney, brother ofthe late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St.George’s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as Iunderstand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read DeQuincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched histobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, asso many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get ridof, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object ofmingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, withyellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in achair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man. One night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell,about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I satup in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made alittle face of disappointment. “A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.” I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day. We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon thelinoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff,with a black veil, entered the room. “You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenlylosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’sneck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in suchtrouble!” she cried; “I do so want a little help.” “Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is KateWhitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when youcame in.” “I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” Thatwas always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to alighthouse. “It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine andwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you ratherthat I sent James off to bed?” “Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’sabout Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened abouthim!” It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’strouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know whereher husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her? It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, whenthe fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back,twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon himeight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of thedocks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to befound, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what']",2938,"Isa Whitney, the brother of the late Elias Whitney, had developed an addiction to opium in an attempt to emulate the dreams and sensations described by DeQuincey. After becoming a slave to the drug, he ended up the object of pity and horror to his friends and family. One night, Isa's wife, Kate, arrived at the narrator's house, frantic and worried about her husband who had not been home for two days. Isa had reportedly been spending his time in an opium den in the far east of the city. Though his past visits had only lasted a day, he had now been gone for 48 hours, likely among the city's dregs, either inhaling the drug or sleeping off its effects. Kate believed he could be found at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane.",732

There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I notescort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come atall? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influenceover him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my wordthat I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at theaddress which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchairand cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on astrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only couldshow how strange it was to be. But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. UpperSwandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line thenorth side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and agin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gaplike the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering mycab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by theceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lampabove the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thickand heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like theforecastle of an emigrant ship. Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strangefantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chinspointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon thenewcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light,now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of themetal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and otherstalked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation comingin gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out hisown thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At thefarther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on athree-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw restingupon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire. As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and asupply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth. “Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is afriend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.” There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through thegloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me. “My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state ofreaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what']",2945,"The protagonist who acts as Isa Whitney's medical adviser, receives a request from Whitney's wife who is worried about her husband being surrounded by ruffians.

Upon reaching there, he finds the place filled with opium addicts lying in strange positions, mostly silent while some mumble or talk in low voices. He spots Whitney, who is in a terrible state of health, and informs him of his intention to take him home.",565

Whatd’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his armsand began to sob in a high treble key. “I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this twodays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!” “So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here afew hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll gohome with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give meyour hand! Have you a cab?” “Yes, I have one waiting.” “Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.” I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding mybreath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking aboutfor the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt asudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, andthen look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. Iglanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet hesat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opiumpipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheerlassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It tookall my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment.He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filledout, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there,sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than SherlockHolmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as heturned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering,loose-lipped senility. “Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in thisden?” “As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. Ifyou would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours Ishould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.” “I have a cab outside.” “Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appearsto be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send anote by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot withme. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.” It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for theywere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air ofmastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab mymission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wishanything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singularadventures which were the normal condition of his existence.

In a very short time a decrepit figurehad emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with SherlockHolmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertainfoot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst intoa hearty fit of laughter. “I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I haveadded opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesseson which you have favoured me with your medical views.” “I was certainly surprised to find you there.” “But not more so than I to find you.” “I came to find a friend.” “And I to find an enemy.” “An enemy?” “Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I havehoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have donebefore now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worthan hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes,and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. Thereis a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’sWharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it uponthe moonless nights.” “What! You do not mean bodies?” “Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for everypoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trapon the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it neverto leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his twoforefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which wasanswered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattleof wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs. “Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up throughthe gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its sidelanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?” “If I can be of use.” “Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.” “The Cedars?” “Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while Iconduct the inquiry.” “Where is it, then?” “Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.” “But I am all in the dark.” “Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump uphere. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Lookout for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head.

A dull wrack was driftingslowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there throughthe rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon hisbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him,curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers sosorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We haddriven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt ofsuburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up hispipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for thebest. “You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “Itmakes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a greatthing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are notover-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little womanto-night when she meets me at the door.” “You forget that I know nothing about it.” “I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we getto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to goupon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the endof it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely toyou, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.” “Proceed, then.” “Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came toLee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty ofmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and livedgenerally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, andin 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has twochildren. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies andwent into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from CannonStreet every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man oftemperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who ispopular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the presentmoment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10s.,while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighingupon his mind. “Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier thanusual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions toperform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, bythe merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, veryshortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerablevalue which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the']",2922,"The passage describes a journey undertaken by Holmes and Watson through a quiet, nighttime scene. Holmes is lost in thought, considering a new case that is troubling him. He praises Watson for his silence, saying he appreciates having him as a companion to talk to, hinting that his thoughts are unsettling. Holmes starts stating the case: a man, Neville St. Clair, moved to Lee in 1884, seeming to have a lot of money. He bought a large villa, made friends, married a local woman, and had two children. St. Clair did not appear to have a job but had interests in companies and a daily routine into town. Despite this, he was not in financial trouble. He left for town one morning, saying he had two important tasks to do and promised a toy for his son. Coincidentally, his wife received a telegram about a parcel of great value waiting for her.

Have you followed me sofar?” “It is very clear.” “If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clairwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not likethe neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this waydown Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struckcold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoningto her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly sawhis face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his handsfrantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that itseemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force frombehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was thatalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had onneither collar nor necktie. “Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down thesteps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you foundme to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascendthe stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however,she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and,aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street.Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and,by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with aninspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two menaccompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of theproprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had lastbeen seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floorthere was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, itseems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no oneelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was theirdenial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe thatMrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small dealbox which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it.

The front room wasplainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which lookedout upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroomwindow is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tidewith at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad oneand opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon thewindowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor ofthe bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all theclothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots,his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs ofviolence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr.Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no otherexit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave littlepromise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its veryhighest at the moment of the tragedy. “And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated inthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as,by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of thestair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at thewindow, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. Hisdefence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had noknowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could notaccount in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes. “So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who livesupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last humanbeing whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and hishideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City.He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations hepretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down ThreadneedleStreet, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a smallangle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteousspectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap whichlies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than oncebefore ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have beensurprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time.

It's believed that Mr. St. Clair exited through the window, as no other exits were found, and high tide and blood on the window suggest that he couldn't have escaped by swimming. Two potential suspects were identified. One, a Lascar, who was near the crime scene but claimed ignorance of the events. The second, a physically disabled man named Hugh Boone who lives in an opium den, was the last person to see Neville.

This is the man whom we nowlearn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last manto see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.” “But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have donesingle-handed against a man in the prime of life?” “He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in otherrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medicalexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is oftencompensated for by exceptional strength in the others.” “Pray continue your narrative.” “Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be ofno help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge ofthe case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without findinganything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made innot arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during whichhe might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soonremedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found whichcould incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his rightshirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near thenail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had beento the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observedthere came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having everseen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in hisroom was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St.Clair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window,he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed,loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon thepremises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue. “And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they hadfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think theyfound in the pockets?” “I cannot imagine.” “No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed withpennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies.

Inspector Barton in charge of the case could not find any incriminating evidence against the man with the limp, named Boone, despite blood on his shirt sleeve. Boone explained the blood as a cut on his finger, and denied knowing anything about the missing man, Neville St. Clair.

Suppose that thisman Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no humaneye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of courseinstantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He wouldseize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occurto him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heardthe scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps hehas already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying upthe street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coinsupon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of thecoat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with theother garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had timeto close the window when the police appeared.” “It certainly sounds feasible.” “Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it couldnot be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had foryears been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been avery quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and thequestions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in theopium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what HughBoone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution asever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which lookedat the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.” While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we hadbeen whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last stragglinghouses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge uponeither side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scatteredvillages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows. “We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We havetouched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.

Aswe approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in theopening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffypink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined againstthe flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness,her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and partedlips, a standing question. “Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that therewere two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw thatmy companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. “No good news?” “None.” “No bad?” “No.” “Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had along day.” “This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me inseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bringhim out and associate him with this investigation.” “I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly.“You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in ourarrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly uponus.” “My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if Iwere not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of anyassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.” “Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-litdining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “Ishould very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I begthat you will give a plain answer.” “Certainly, madam.” “Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given tofainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.” “Upon what point?” “In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?” Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly,now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at himas he leaned back in a basket-chair. “Frankly, then, madam, I do not.” “You think that he is dead?” “I do.” “Murdered?” “I don’t say that. Perhaps.” “And on what day did he meet his death?” “On Monday.” “Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it isthat I have received a letter from him to-day.” Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised. “What!” he roared. “Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paperin the air. “May I see it?” “Certainly.”']",2853,"Sherlock Holmes and his associate Dr. Watson arrive at the home of a little blonde woman in search of news about her husband, Neville.

I had left my chair and wasgazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and wasstamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, orrather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight. “Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not yourhusband’s writing, madam.” “No, but the enclosure is.” “I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go andinquire as to the address.” “How can you tell that?” “The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has beenused. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of adeep black shade.

He waved his hands.” “But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpectedsight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?” “It is possible.” “And you thought he was pulled back?” “He disappeared so suddenly.” “He might have leaped back.

Itwas soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. Hetook off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and thenwandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from thesofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, uponwhich he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a boxof matches laid out in front of him.

No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boysleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself ashe spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombrethinker of the previous night. As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring.It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmesreturned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse. “I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on hisboots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of oneof the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here toCharing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.” “And where is it?” I asked, smiling. “In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am notjoking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have justbeen there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.” We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the brightmorning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-cladstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down theLondon Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to themetropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifelessas some city in a dream. “It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flickingthe horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as amole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it atall.” In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from theirwindows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down theWaterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up WellingtonStreet wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. SherlockHolmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door salutedhim. One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in. “Who is on duty?” asked Holmes. “Inspector Bradstreet, sir.” “Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come downthe stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish tohave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.” “Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.” It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and atelephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk. “What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?” “I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged withbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.” “Yes.

That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave yourbag.” “No, I think that I’ll take it.” “Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down apassage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to awhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side. “The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here itis!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door andglanced through. “He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.” We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us,in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man,coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding throughthe rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremelydirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsiveugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin,and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that threeteeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grewlow over his eyes and forehead. “He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector. “He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an ideathat he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” Heopened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a verylarge bath-sponge. “He! he!
