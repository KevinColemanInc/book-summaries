Sherlock Homes,5,1,"['When I glance over mynotes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years ’82 and’90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting featuresthat it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some,however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have notoffered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in sohigh a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginningswithout an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and havetheir explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on thatabsolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one ofthese last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in itsresults that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact thatthere are points in connection with it which never have been, and probablynever will be, entirely cleared up. The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or lessinterest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this onetwelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of theAmateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of afurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barqueSophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in theisland of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, asmay be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’swatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that thereforethe deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was ofthe greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out atsome future date, but none of them present such singular features as thestrange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe. It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set inwith exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain hadbeaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-madeLondon we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine oflife and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriekat mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage.As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried andsobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side ofthe fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other wasdeep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of thegale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain tolengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves.

Some cases have gained notoriety through the newspapers, while others remain unsolved or not fully solved. The narrator highlights a particularly remarkable and puzzling case from 1887, mentioning other notable cases from that year, including the adventure of the Paradol Chamber and the Camberwell poisoning case. The latter was solved by Holmes by analyzing the deceased's watch.

Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?” “Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do notencourage visitors.” “A client, then?” “If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on sucha day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be somecrony of the landlady’s.” Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step inthe passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turnthe lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomermust sit. “Come in!” said he. The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomedand trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. Thestreaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterprooftold of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about himanxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale andhis eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some greatanxiety. “I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez tohis eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have broughtsome traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.” “Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may resthere on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from thesouth-west, I see.” “Yes, from Horsham.” “That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quitedistinctive.” “I have come for advice.” “That is easily got.” “And help.” “That is not always so easy.” “I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how yousaved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.” “Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.” “He said that you could solve anything.” “He said too much.” “That you are never beaten.” “I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by awoman.” “But what is that compared with the number of your successes?” “It is true that I have been generally successful.” “Then you may be so with me.” “I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me withsome details as to your case.” “It is no ordinary one.” “None of those which come to me are. I am the last court ofappeal.” “And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have everlistened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those whichhave happened in my own family.” “You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us theessential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as tothose details which seem to me to be most important.” The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards theblaze.']",2883,"The narrator, back in his former lodgings on Baker Street, is joined by a visitor on a stormy evening.

It isa hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must goback to the commencement of the affair. “You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias andmy father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlargedat the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshawunbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able tosell it and to retire upon a handsome competence. “My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became aplanter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the timeof the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, wherehe rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to hisplantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 hecame back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He hadmade a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving themwas his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy inextending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce andquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiringdisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever heset foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house,and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end hewould never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked veryheavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even hisown brother. “He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the timewhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in theyear 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged myfather to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When hewas sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and hewould make me his representative both with the servants and with thetradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of thehouse. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, solong as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception,however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which wasinvariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else toenter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but Iwas never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles aswould be expected in such a room. “One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamplay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate.

What can this be?’ Opening ithurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered downupon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lipsat the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, hisskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held inhis trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘MyGod, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’ “‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried. “‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retiredto his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and sawscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K threetimes repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could bethe reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as Iascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must havebelonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, inthe other. “‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate themstill,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a firein my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’ “I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step upto the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a massof black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open andempty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon thelid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope. “‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witnessmy will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages,to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If youcan enjoy it in peace, well and good!

Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread whichit left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed andnothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives.

When these hotfits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock andbar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against theterror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face,even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from abasin. “Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse yourpatience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies fromwhich he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, facedownward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden.There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so thatthe jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought ofdeath, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meetit. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of theestate, and of some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.” “One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, Iforesee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me havethe date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of hissupposed suicide.” “The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,upon the night of May 2nd.” “Thank you. Pray proceed.” “When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made acareful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found thebrass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of thecover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.

But what is this written above them?’ “‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping overhis shoulder. “‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked. “‘The sundial in the garden.

I had begun totake comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the veryshape in which it had come upon my father.” The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to thetable he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips. “This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark isLondon—eastern division.

We have not yetgrasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may besolved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution bythe aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it isnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which havecome to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, apossession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education andencyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment.

In the first place,we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some verystrong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change alltheir habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for thelonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude inEngland suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so wemay assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or somethingwhich drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deducethat by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself andhis successors.

In the case of Pondicherry,seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it wasonly some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?” “A greater distance to travel.” “But the letter had also a greater distance to come.” “Then I do not see the point.” “There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or menare is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warningor token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly thedeed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come fromPondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as theirletter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those sevenweeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letterand the sailing vessel which brought the writer.” “It is possible.” “More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency ofthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has alwaysfallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel thedistance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upondelay.” “Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentlesspersecution?” “The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance tothe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear thatthere must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried outtwo deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must havebeen several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this wayyou see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes thebadge of a society.”']",2923,"Colonel Openshaw likely had a significant reason for leaving America, as he didn't seem to enjoy his life in England, suggesting he possibly fled out of fear. He and his successors received letters that induce fear, originated from various places indicated by their postmarks - Pondicherry, Dundee, and East London. This suggests the letter writer was probably traveling by ship. The time lapse between the threatening letters and the events following also implied the sender was likely on a sailing ship, not a faster steamer. Therefore, the current letter from London implies impending danger with no time delay. The documents Openshaw had occupy exceptional importance to those in the sailing-ship, who are likely many, determined, and resourceful. The initials K.K.K., in consequence, represent a society rather than an individual.",835
Sherlock Homes,5,11,"['badge of a society.” “But of what society?” “Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward andsinking his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?” “I never have.” Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here itis,” said he presently: “‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblanceto the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society wasformed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the CivilWar, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country,notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its powerwas used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negrovoters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposedto its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to themarked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig ofoak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receivingthis the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly fromthe country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come uponhim, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was theorganisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there ishardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity,or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For someyears the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United Statesgovernment and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually,in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there havebeen sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’ “You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume,“that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with thedisappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have beencause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the moreimplacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register anddiary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may bemany who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.” “Then the page we have seen—” “Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent thepips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning tothem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left thecountry, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and Ibelieve that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what Ihave told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so handme over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserableweather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”']",2933,"In Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, Holmes explains the history and operations of the Ku Klux Klan to an uninformed character. He states that the society was formed by ex-Confederate soldiers, spread throughout the Southern states, and was mainly used for political terrorising, especially against Black voters and opponents of the group's views. Victims were usually warned with a symbol, such as a sprig of oak leaves, and if the warnings were ignored, death would usually follow. Holmes notes that the society collapsed in 1869, possibly linked to the disappearance of a character named Openshaw and his papers that could incriminate powerful people. Holmes suggests that a note they found indicates that the society's warning had been sent to three individuals and believes that Openshaw's only chance is to follow Holmes' advice.",845
Sherlock Homes,5,12,"['It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subduedbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. SherlockHolmes was already at breakfast when I came down. “You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “Ihave, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of youngOpenshaw’s.” “What steps will you take?” I asked. “It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I mayhave to go down to Horsham, after all.” “You will not go there first?” “No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid willbring up your coffee.” As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eyeover it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart. “Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.” “Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. Howwas it done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved. “My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy NearWaterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account: “‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, ofthe H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splashin the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, inspite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect arescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, thebody was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whosename, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was JohnOpenshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he mayhave been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and thatin his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over theedge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The bodyexhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceasedhad been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect ofcalling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riversidelanding-stages.’” We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I hadever seen him. “That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is apetty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matterwith me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to hisdeath—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room inuncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervousclasping and unclasping of his long thin hands. “They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “Howcould they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the directline to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a']",2871,"The story is set in a city where Sherlock Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson, had been looking into a case concerning a young individual, Openshaw. Holmes is found at breakfast, implying a forecast of a busy day following up on the case. The initial plans regarding the investigation are undecided, with the City being the primary location to start before possibly moving down to Horsham. As his companion waited, Watson finds a distressing newspaper headline regarding a 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge' involving Openshaw. A police constable had heard a cry for help near the bridge, and though passers-by attempted to assist, the stormy, dark night made a rescue impossible, eventually leading to the recovery of a corpse. The deceased was identified as one John Openshaw from Horsham. It was inferred that John, in his rush and the extreme darkness, misstepped and fell off a landing place for river steamboats resulting in an accidental death, which again raises a spotlight on the precariousness of riverside landing stage’s conditions. This revelation left Holmes and Watson solemnly quiet, and noticeably, Holmes was upset and distressed. His pride was hurt due to the fact that Openshaw had come seeking his help and he ended up being sent to his death. A disturbed Holmes paced about the room, questioning the cunning nature of the criminals who potentially could have lured Openshaw down to the embankment, which was not part of the direct route to the station.",1476

When I have spun the web they may take theflies, but not before.” All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the eveningbefore I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. Itwas nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. Hewalked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured itvoraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water. “You are hungry,” I remarked. “Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing sincebreakfast.” “Nothing?” “Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.” “And how have you succeeded?” “Well.” “You have a clue?” “I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not longremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark uponthem. It is well thought of!” “What do you mean?” He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed outthe pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into anenvelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Thenhe sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque LoneStar, Savannah, Georgia.” “That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling.“It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursorof his fate as Openshaw did before him.” “And who is this Captain Calhoun?” “The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.” “How did you trace it, then?” He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates andnames. “I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’sregisters and files of the old papers, following the future career of everyvessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. Therewere thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during thosemonths. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention,since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is thatwhich is given to one of the states of the Union.” “Texas, I think.” “I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have anAmerican origin.” “What then?” “I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque LoneStar was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. Ithen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port ofLondon.” “Yes?” “The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to theAlbert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tidethis morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned thatshe had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt thatshe is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.” “What will you do, then?”']",2881,"Sherlock Holmes spent the day investigating and finally linked Captain James Calhoun of the ship Lone Star to the crime. Holmes had been without food or a break all day in his pursuits. He revealed that he sent a message to Calhoun, similar to the one John Openshaw had received before his death, aiming to intimidate him. Holmes further explained his investigation process to Watson, detailing how he followed the paths of all ships reported at Pondicherry in early 1883, working from Lloyd's registers and old newspaper files. Discovering that the Lone Star, though registered from London, had an American origin and was now homeward bound, made Holmes certain of its relevance to the case.",692

By the time that theirsailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, andthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemenare badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.” There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and themurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which wouldshow them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upontheir track.
