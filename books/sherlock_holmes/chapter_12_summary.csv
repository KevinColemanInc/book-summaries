Sherlock Homes,12,1,"['“To the man wholoves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside theadvertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph, “it is frequently inits least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is tobe derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so fargrasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you havebeen good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish,you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres andsensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents whichmay have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for thosefaculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my specialprovince.” “And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myselfabsolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against myrecords.” “You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinderwith the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont toreplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditativemood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and lifeinto each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task ofplacing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is reallythe only notable feature about the thing.” “It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” Iremarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had morethan once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singularcharacter. “No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as washis wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice formy art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than uponthe crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been acourse of lectures into a series of tales.” It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on eitherside of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled downbetween the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed likedark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit andshone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had notbeen cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dippingcontinuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until atlast, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweettemper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings. “At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he hadsat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you canhardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you']",2883,"Sherlock Holmes praises Dr. Watson for focusing on the logic and deduction applied in their cases, rather than the sensational aspects, in the accounts Watson has written. However, Holmes criticises Watson for adding 'colour and life' to the stories, believing it detracts from the logical process. Watson defends himself and hints that Holmes comes across as egotistical, a notion Holmes dismisses, stating his insistence on logic is about giving 'justice' to his art. The conversation takes place over breakfast in their shared Baker Street residence, during a foggy spring morning.",584

The small matter in which I endeavoured tohelp the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, theproblem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of thenoble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But inavoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on thetrivial.” “The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods Ihold to have been novel and of interest.” “Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public,who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb,care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!

It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus: “DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether Ishould or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me asgoverness. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenienceyou. Yours faithfully, “VIOLET HUNTER.” “Do you know the young lady?” I asked. “Not I.” “It is half-past ten now.” “Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.” “It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember thatthe affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first,developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.” “Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.” As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainlybut neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’segg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make inthe world. “You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as mycompanion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience,and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice,I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I shoulddo.” “Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that Ican to serve you.” I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech ofhis new client.

I advertised, and Ianswered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which Ihad saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what Ishould do. “There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End calledWestaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to seewhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name ofthe founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sitsin her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in ananteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers andsees whether she has anything which would suit them. “Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office asusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout manwith a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold uponfold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose,looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite ajump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper. “‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask foranything better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic andrubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such acomfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him. “‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked. “‘Yes, sir.’ “‘As governess?’ “‘Yes, sir.’ “‘And what salary do you ask?’ “‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel SpenceMunro.’ “‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ hecried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boilingpassion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with suchattractions and accomplishments?’ “‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than youimagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, music, anddrawing—’ “‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite besidethe question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportmentof a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted forthe rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the historyof the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you tocondescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’ “You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such anoffer seemed almost too good to be true.

As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a greatconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transactionwhich made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself. “‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I. “‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, fivemiles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dearyoung lady, and the dearest old country-house.’ “‘And my duties, sir?

After all, if these people hadstrange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, theywere at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses inEngland are getting £ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Manypeople are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among thenumber. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by theday after I was sure of it.

I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed someopinion?” “Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastleseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife isa lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should betaken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order toprevent an outbreak?” “That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is themost probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household fora young lady.” “But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!” “Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makesme uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have theirpick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.” “I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understandafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt thatyou were at the back of me.” “Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that yourlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way forsome months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features.

Afortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in herdirection and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonelywoman had strayed into.

The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I wasthinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-nightchemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave himstooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the sameposition when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellowenvelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me. “Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back tohis chemical studies. The summons was a brief and urgent one. “Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at middayto-morrow,” it said. “Do come!

It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked withlittle fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun wasshining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, whichset an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to therolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of thefarm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage. “Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasmof a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.

You look at these scattered houses, and you areimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes tome is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may becommitted there.” “Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime withthese dear old homesteads?” “They always fill me with a certain horror.

You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laugheduntil I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense ofhumour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarkedthat it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change mydress and go to little Edward in the nursery. “Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactlysimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, andagain I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had animmense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me ayellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadowmight not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read forabout ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, inthe middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress. “You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what themeaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be.

Atfirst it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirrorhad been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of theglass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, Iput my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to seeall that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There wasnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however,I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a smallbearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The roadis an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however,was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was lookingearnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to findher eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I amconvinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen whatwas behind me. She rose at once. “‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinentfellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’ “‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked. “‘No, I know no one in these parts.’ “‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motionto him to go away.’ “‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’ “‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindlyturn round and wave him away like that.’ “I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down theblind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in thewindow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.” “Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to bea most interesting one.” “You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to belittle relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the veryfirst day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a smallouthouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard thesharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about. “‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slitbetween two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’ “I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vaguefigure huddled up in the darkness. “‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer,laughing at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, mymastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man whocan do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, sothat he is always as keen as mustard.

On the first day at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle introduces them to a large and dangerous dog named Carlo who is only handled by Toller, the groom, and is used to prevent trespassing.

It was a beautifulmoonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over andalmost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of thescene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of thecopper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was agiant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle,and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished intothe shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heartwhich I do not think that any burglar could have done. “And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as youknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at thebottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amusemyself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own littlethings. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones emptyand open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, andas I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the useof the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mereoversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very firstkey fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thingin it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil ofhair. “I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and thesame thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself uponme. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands Iundid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Wasit not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what itmeant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of thematter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by openinga drawer which they had locked. “I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and Isoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing,however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced thatwhich led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it wasinvariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on hisface which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom Iwas accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and']",2942,"The narrator was warned not to go outside at night due to a large, fearsome dog. Later, they found their own hair, which had been cut off in London and kept in a trunk, inexplicably locked in a drawer in a chest. The narrator couldn't understand how it ended up there. They also observed an uninhabited part of the house. One day, they met Mr. Rucastle coming out of a normally locked door leading to that part, looking angry and different from his usual jovial self.",467
Sherlock Homes,12,13,"['the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurriedpast me without a word or a look. “This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the groundswith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windowsof this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of whichwere simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently alldeserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever. “‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if Ipassed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with businessmatters.’ “I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I,‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of themhas the shutters up.’ “He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at myremark. “‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘Ihave made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady wehave come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believedit?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as helooked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest. “Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there wassomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fireto go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. Itwas more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from mypenetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it waswoman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door. “It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besidesMr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these desertedrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through thedoor. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was verydrunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubtat all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs,and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turnedthe key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through. “There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were threedoors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into anempty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in theother, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened oneof the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall,']",2898,"The narrator observes a man, Mr. Rucastle, in a state of passion. He hurries past her without acknowledgement, which piques her curiosity. When she notices four windows in the house, three dirty and one shuttered, and comments on it, Mr. Rucastle reacts with surprise and annoyance. He explains that the shuttered room is his dark room for photography. The narrator becomes suspicious as there is an air of secrecy about these rooms and is eager to investigate. She gets her opportunity when she finds the key left in the door by Toller, who has been seen carrying a large black bag into these rooms. Upon entering, she discovers a passage leading to three rooms, the middle one secured with an iron bar and padlock.",716

This barricaded door corresponded clearly with theshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath itthat the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let inlight from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door andwondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps withinthe room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit ofdim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror roseup in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, andI turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind meclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through thedoor, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside. “‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. Ithought that it must be when I saw the door open.’ “‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted. “‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—youcannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and whathas frightened you, my dear young lady?’ “But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenlyon my guard against him. “‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ Ianswered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I wasfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’ “‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly. “‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked. “‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’ “‘I am sure that I do not know.’ “‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do yousee?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner. “‘I am sure if I had known—’ “‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your footover that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardenedinto a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of ademon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’ “I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I musthave rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myselflying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I couldnot live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, ofthe man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were allhorrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course Imight have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as myfears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat andcloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, andthen returned, feeling very much easier.

My friendrose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and anexpression of the most profound gravity upon his face. “Is Toller still drunk?” he asked. “Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing withhim.” “That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?” “Yes.” “Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?” “Yes, the wine-cellar.” “You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very braveand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one morefeat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptionalwoman.” “I will try. What is it?” “We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend andI. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, beincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If youcould send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her,you would facilitate matters immensely.” “I will do it.” “Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of coursethere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there topersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That isobvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America.You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colourof your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness throughwhich she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By acurious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedlysome friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as youwore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from yourlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that MissRucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicatewith her.

At that hour we shall be with you,and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.” We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the CopperBeeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees,with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the settingsun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standingsmiling on the door-step. “Have you managed it?” asked Holmes. A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on thekitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.Rucastle’s.” “You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm.“Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this blackbusiness.” We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, andfound ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar.

It was empty. There was no furniture save alittle pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight abovewas open, and the prisoner gone. “There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “thisbeauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victimoff.” “But how?” “Through the skylight.

I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’llserve you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he couldgo. “He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter. “I have my revolver,” said I. “Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed downthe stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying ofa hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which itwas dreadful to listen to.

Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!” Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurryingbehind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried inRucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Runningup, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth stillmeeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated themand carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him uponthe drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear thenews to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembledround him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room. “Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter. “Yes, miss.

Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and withher beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her youngman, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.” “Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been goodenough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all thatremains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system ofimprisonment?” “Yes, sir.” “And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of thedisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.” “That was it, sir.” “But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same ashis.” “Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” saidMrs. Toller serenely. “And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want ofdrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master hadgone out.” “You have it, sir, just as it happened.” “I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes,“for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us.
