Sherlock Homes,1,1,"['To Sherlock Holmes sheis always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any othername. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It wasnot that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, andthat one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirablybalanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observingmachine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself ina false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and asneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawingthe veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner toadmit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament wasto introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mentalresults. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his ownhigh-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in anature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman wasthe late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from eachother. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise uparound the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, weresufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form ofsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaineand ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keennature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, andoccupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation infollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had beenabandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard somevague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of theTrepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinsonbrothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplishedso delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond thesesigns of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers ofthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returningfrom a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when myway led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, whichmust always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the darkincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to seeHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. Hisrooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare']",2929,"This excerpt describes the narrator's reflections on his old friend, Sherlock Holmes, and his unique relationship with Irene Adler, the only woman Holmes ever took note of, not for romantic reasons but due to her impressive mind. The narrator mentions his drift from Holmes due to his own marriage and domestic life. Despite Holmes' distaste for society and his Bohemian lifestyle, marked by periods of drug use and intense focus on his work, the narrator is aware of his friend's continued success in solving complex crimes that baffle the police. In March 1888, the narrator, having returned to his medical practice, comes across their old lodgings in Baker Street and is filled with a desire to reconnect with Holmes and learn about his latest ventures.",757

To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and mannertold their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of hisdrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang thebell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to seeme. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to anarmchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and agasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in hissingular introspective fashion. “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that youhave put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.” “Seven!” I answered. “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, Ifancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that youintended to go into harness.” “Then, how do you know?” “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourselfvery wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servantgirl?” “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You wouldcertainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true thatI had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as Ihave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to MaryJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again,I fail to see how you work it out.” He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that onthe inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leatheris scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused bysomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order toremove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you hadbeen out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignantboot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if agentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark ofnitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side ofhis top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medicalprofession.” I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process ofdeduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I couldeasily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I ambaffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are asgood as yours.”']",2915,"The unnamed narrator visits the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, who is deeply engrossed in a new case. Holmes greets him with his usual aloofness but notes that the narrator seems happy in his marriage and has resumed his medical practice. When asked how he came to these conclusions, Holmes points to physical evidence like a weight gain and the presence of medical indicators like iodoform, nitrate of silver and a bulge from a hidden stethoscope. In response to the narrator’s wonder at his deductive abilities, Holmes passively comments that the deductions are incredibly easy to make once one knows what to look for.",624
Sherlock Homes,1,3,"['good as yours.” “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himselfdown into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinctionis clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up fromthe hall to this room.” “Frequently.” “How often?” “Well, some hundreds of times.” “Then how many are there?” “How many? I don’t know.” “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just mypoint. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen andobserved. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, andsince you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences,you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It cameby the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.” The note was undated, and without either signature or address. “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eighto’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult youupon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of theroyal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trustedwith matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. Thisaccount of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then atthat hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.” “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imaginethat it means?” “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one hasdata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead oftheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?” I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper couldnot be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong andstiff.” “Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It isnot an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.” I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a“P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woveninto the texture of the paper. “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes. “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.” “Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ standsfor ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ ofcourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let usglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volumefrom his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in aGerman-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for itsnumerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do youmake of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant']",2919,"In this passage, a character, presumably Sherlock Holmes, is teaching another person about observation, emphasizing that he sees things differently because he actually observes rather than just seeing them. He demonstrates this by asking how many steps there are leading up to the room, a fact which his companion doesn't know despite having seen the stairs hundreds of times. Following this, Holmes receives a mysterious note asking for a specific appointment. He begins analyzing the note, using his skills of observation to conclude that the paper the note is written on is foreign and from a German-speaking country. The passage illustrates the Sherlock Holmes classic blend of deduction and observation skills.",715

Do you note thepeculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we havefrom all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not havewritten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It onlyremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes uponBohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here hecomes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.” As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheelsagainst the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued,glancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair ofbeauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case,Watson, if there is nothing else.” “I think that I had better go, Holmes.” “Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. Andthis promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.” “But your client—” “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sitdown in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.” A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage,paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritativetap. “Come in!” said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches inheight, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with arichness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavybands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of hisdouble-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over hisshoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with abrooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfwayup his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his wholeappearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore acrossthe upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizardmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was stillraised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be aman of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chinsuggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. “You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a stronglymarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He lookedfrom one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. “Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend andcolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.Whom have I the honour to address?”']",2915,"Sherlock Holmes deduces that the author of a letter is a German who uses Bohemian paper due to the grammatical structure and the paper's origin. The German appears to be the one arriving at Holmes' residence, indicated by the sound of horses and a carriage. The man is described as extremely tall, physically imposing, and dressed in rich, ostentatious clothing. He wears a mask and identifies himself to Holmes and Watson with a German accent. Holmes, in return, introduces his colleague, Dr. Watson to the masked man. As they prepare to converse, Holmes implies that the case appears to be financially promising.",614

Iunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion,whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I shouldmuch prefer to communicate with you alone.” I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into mychair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say beforethis gentleman anything which you may say to me.” The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” saidhe, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end ofthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much tosay that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon Europeanhistory.” “I promise,” said Holmes. “And I.” “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you,and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself isnot exactly my own.” “I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly. “The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to betaken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriouslycompromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matterimplicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.” “I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself downin his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figureof the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasonerand most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and lookedimpatiently at his gigantic client. “If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked,“I should be better able to advise you.” The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollableagitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his faceand hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “Iam the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?” “Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spokenbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond vonOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.” “But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting downonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you canunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent withoutputting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for thepurpose of consulting you.” “Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more. “The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visitto Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.']",2933,"A Bohemian nobleman, Count Von Kramm, visits detective Sherlock Holmes, seeking help with a matter of great importance that could affect European history. The nobleman requires secrecy and later reveals that he is not a nobleman, but Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, the Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia.

He reveals that the matter involves a well-known adventuress named Irene Adler, whom he met five years ago in Warsaw.",567
Sherlock Homes,1,6,"['The name is no doubt familiar to you.” “Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes withoutopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing allparagraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name asubject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In thiscase I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi andthat of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes. “Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in theyear 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera ofWarsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living inLondon—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled withthis young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous ofgetting those letters back.” “Precisely so. But how—” “Was there a secret marriage?” “None.” “No legal papers or certificates?” “None.” “Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produceher letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove theirauthenticity?” “There is the writing.” “Pooh, pooh! Forgery.” “My private note-paper.” “Stolen.” “My own seal.” “Imitated.” “My photograph.” “Bought.” “We were both in the photograph.” “Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed anindiscretion.” “I was mad—insane.” “You have compromised yourself seriously.” “I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.” “It must be recovered.” “We have tried and failed.” “Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.” “She will not sell.” “Stolen, then.” “Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked herhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has beenwaylaid. There has been no result.” “No sign of it?” “Absolutely none.” Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he. “But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully. “Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with thephotograph?” “To ruin me.” “But how?” “I am about to be married.” “So I have heard.” “To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King ofScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herselfthe very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring thematter to an end.” “And Irene Adler?” “Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know thatshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has theface of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which shewould not go—none.” “You are sure that she has not sent it yet?” “I am sure.” “And why?” “Because she has said that she would send it on the day when thebetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”']",2881,"Sherlock Holmes is consulted by a king who has been involved with a woman named Irene Adler.

Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for thepresent?” “Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the CountVon Kramm.” “Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.” “Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.” “Then, as to money?” “You have carte blanche.” “Absolutely?” “I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to havethat photograph.” “And for present expenses?” The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it onthe table. “There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred innotes,” he said. Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him. “And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked. “Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.” Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Wasthe photograph a cabinet?” “It was.” “Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have somegood news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels ofthe royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough tocall to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat thislittle matter over with you.” At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yetreturned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly aftereight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, withthe intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeplyinterested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grimand strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I havealready recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of hisclient gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of theinvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterlygrasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it apleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtlemethods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomedwas I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing hadceased to enter into my head. It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom,ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes,walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powersin the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that itwas indeed he.

I suppose that you have been watching the habits,and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.” “Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.

Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage windowcould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it andexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything elseof interest. “I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there wasa mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlersa hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glassof half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I coulddesire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in theneighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographiesI was compelled to listen to.” “And what of Irene Adler?” I asked. “Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She isthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day,and returns at seven sharp for dinner.

Theydrove away in different directions, and I went off to make my ownarrangements.” “Which are?” “Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing thebell. “I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to bebusier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want yourco-operation.” “I shall be delighted.” “You don’t mind breaking the law?” “Not in the least.” “Nor running a chance of arrest?” “Not in a good cause.” “Oh, the cause is excellent!” “Then I am your man.” “I was sure that I might rely on you.” “But what is it you wish?” “When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.Now,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landladyhad provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. MissIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at BrionyLodge to meet her.” “And what then?” “You must leave that to me.

Following the wedding, the pair separate, leaving the narrator to contemplate his next move.

Yourtask is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken upby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and Iwill rejoin you in ten minutes.

I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I preparefor the new role I have to play.” He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the characterof an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat,his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look ofpeering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could haveequalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression,his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when hebecame a specialist in crime. It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted tenminutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It wasalready dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down infront of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house wasjust such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinctdescription, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. Onthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkablyanimated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in acorner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting witha nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and downwith cigars in their mouths. “You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of thehouse, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes adouble-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to itsbeing seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes ofhis princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?” “Where, indeed?” “It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinetsize.

The man named Holmes comments on the situation, saying that the photograph would be a dangerous thing for both their client and a woman named Mr. Godfrey Norton.

But I aminclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to dotheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She couldtrust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or politicalinfluence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember thatshe had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay herhands upon it. It must be in her own house.” “But it has twice been burgled.” “Pshaw! They did not know how to look.” “But how will you look?” “I will not look.” “What then?” “I will get her to show me.” “But she will refuse.” “She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is hercarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.” As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve ofthe avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of BrionyLodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward toopen the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by anotherloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out,which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of theloungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from hercarriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, whostruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed intothe crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry anddropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fallthe guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in theother, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scufflewithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to theinjured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps;but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights ofthe hall, looking back into the street. “Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “He is dead,” cried several voices. “No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “Buthe’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.” “He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would havehad the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They werea gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.” “He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?” “Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room.

I do not know whether he was seizedwith compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that Inever felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw thebeautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindlinesswith which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackesttreachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted tome. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. Afterall, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her frominjuring another. Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is inneed of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the sameinstant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into theroom with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouththan the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen,ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out atthe open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later thevoice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slippingthrough the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and inten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get awayfrom the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutesuntil we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards theEdgeware Road. “You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing couldhave been better. It is all right.” “You have the photograph?” “I know where it is.” “And how did you find out?” “She showed me, as I told you she would.” “I am still in the dark.” “I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “Thematter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the streetwas an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.” “I guessed as much.” “Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palmof my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and becamea piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.” “That also I could fathom.” “Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else couldshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.

When I cried out that it was a false alarm, shereplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seenher since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitatedwhether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had comein, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait.

We will be shown into thesitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes shemay find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to hisMajesty to regain it with his own hands.” “And when will you call?” “At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have aclear field.

He was searching hispockets for the key when someone passing said: “Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.” There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greetingappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. “I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down thedimly lit street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could havebeen.” I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast andcoffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room. “You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes byeither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “Not yet.” “But you have hopes?” “I have hopes.” “Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.” “No, my brougham is waiting.” “Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started offonce more for Briony Lodge. “Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes. “Married!

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she. “I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with aquestioning and rather startled gaze. “Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left thismorning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for theContinent.” “What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin andsurprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?” “Never to return.” “And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All islost.” “We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into thedrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scatteredabout in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if thelady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at thebell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulledout a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself inevening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. Tobe left till called for.” My friend tore it open, and we all three readit together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in thisway: “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You tookme in completely.

Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not apity that she was not on my level?” “From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a verydifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorrythat I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a moresuccessful conclusion.” “On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothingcould be more successful.
