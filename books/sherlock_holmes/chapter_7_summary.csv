Sherlock Homes,7,1,"['I had called upon myfriend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with theintention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging uponthe sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon theright, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near athand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung avery seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and crackedin several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chairsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose ofexamination. “You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.” “Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss myresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumbin the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connectionwith it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even ofinstruction.” I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire,for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.“I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, thisthing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue whichwill guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of somecrime.” “No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only oneof those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have fourmillion human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few squaremiles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, everypossible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a littleproblem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without beingcriminal. We have already had experience of such.” “So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which Ihave added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legalcrime.” “Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the manwith the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fallinto the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?” “Yes.” “It is to him that this trophy belongs.” “It is his hat.” “No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look uponit not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, asto how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a goodfat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front ofPeterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock onChristmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, wasreturning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward downTottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man,']",2900,"The narrator visits Sherlock Holmes post-Christmas and finds him examining a battered hat. Holmes, in a casual manner, discusses the hat as an 'intellectual problem' rather than a criminal clue. He explains that this hat, along with a goose, was found on Christmas morning by a man named Peterson. Despite the mundane nature of the object, Holmes finds the circumstances of its discovery interesting and potentially instructive.",428
Sherlock Homes,7,2,"['walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over hisshoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out betweenthis stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off theman’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swingingit over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushedforward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked athaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniformrushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amidthe labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left inpossession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in theshape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.” “Which surely he restored to their owner?” “My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to thebird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H.B.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are somethousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, itis not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.” “What, then, did Peterson do?” “He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowingthat even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retaineduntil this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost,it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finderhas carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, whileI continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmasdinner.” “Did he not advertise?” “No.” “Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?” “Only as much as we can deduce.” “From his hat?” “Precisely.” “But you are joking. What can you gather from this old batteredfelt?” “Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as tothe individuality of the man who has worn this article?” I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. Itwas a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worsefor wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials“H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim fora hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to havebeen some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink. “I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend. “On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to']",2896,"The passage describes an episode where a man, carrying a white goose, gets into a fight with some rough individuals. When his hat gets knocked off, he swings a stick to defend himself, unintentionally breaking a shop window. Seeing Peterson, who looks like someone of authority, rushing toward him, the man flees, leaving behind his goose and hat. Peterson, unable to locate the man whose hat had the initials 'H.B.' and a small card tied to the Goose bearing the name 'Mrs. Henry Baker', takes these items to Sherlock Holmes.

Sherlock Homes,7,3,"['reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.” “Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?” He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which wascharacteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might havebeen,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which arevery distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance ofprobability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon theface of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years,although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less nowthan formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with thedecline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife hasceased to love him.” “My dear Holmes!” “He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” hecontinued, disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads asedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which heanoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to bededuced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that hehas gas laid on in his house.” “You are certainly joking, Holmes.” “Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you theseresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?” “I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I amunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man wasintellectual?” For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over theforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question ofcubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must havesomething in it.” “The decline of his fortunes, then?” “This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came inthen. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk andthe excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat threeyears ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in theworld.” “Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight andthe moral retrogression?” Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he puttinghis finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They arenever sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amountof foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against thewind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled toreplace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, whichis a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has']",2897,"The character speaking is Sherlock Holmes, who is examining a hat to deduce information about its owner. He asserts that the man is highly intellectual, had been well-off three years ago but is now facing financial troubles. Holmes suggests that the man's current state could be due to alcohol. Furthermore, he deduces that the man is middle-aged, leads a sedentary life, and is likely facing marital issues as his wife may no longer love him. He has recently had his hair cut and applies lime-cream. It's unlikely that he has gas in his house. Holmes explains his reasoning behind these deductions, including the size of the hat alluding to the man's intellect, and the quality and age of the hat indicating a prior wealthy status. Moreover, taking measures against wind suggests foresight, but the broken elastic suggests the lack thereof.",841
Sherlock Homes,7,4,"['endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them withink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.” “Your reasoning is certainly plausible.” “The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to begathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lensdiscloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but thefluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors mostof the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positivethat the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in thebest of training.” “But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.” “This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson,with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wifeallows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have beenunfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.” “But he might be a bachelor.” “Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.” “You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce thatthe gas is not laid on in his house?” “One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see noless than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual mustbe brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs atnight probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?” “Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since,as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done savethe loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.” Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, andPeterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks andthe face of a man who is dazed with astonishment. “The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped. “Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off throughthe kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get afairer view of the man’s excited face. “See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held outhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillatingblue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiancethat it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand. Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” saidhe, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you havegot?”']",2899,"In the excerpt from Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle,"" Sherlock Holmes uses a hat to make detailed deductions about its owner. He guesses the owner dyes his graying hair, uses lime cream, and is not physically fit based on an examination of the hat's lining. From the hat's dirty state, he surmises the owner's wife has stopped caring about his appearance, indicating marital trouble. Holmes gathers the man uses candles instead of gas since there are numerous tallow stains on the hat. This conversation is interrupted when the commissionaire, Peterson, rushes in revealing that his wife found a valuable blue stone in the goose he was bringing home.

It is the preciousstone.” “Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated. “Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I haveread the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It isabsolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the rewardoffered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the marketprice.” “A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaireplumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us. “That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimentalconsiderations in the background which would induce the Countess to part withhalf her fortune if she could but recover the gem.” “It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” Iremarked. “Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, aplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to theAssizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He rummagedamid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed oneout, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph: “Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was broughtup upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from thejewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the bluecarbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to theeffect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess ofMorcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second barof the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time,but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner haddisappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small moroccocasket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed tokeep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gavethe alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not befound either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to theCountess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discoveringthe robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters asdescribed by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidenceas to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested hisinnocence in the strongest terms.

Strong evidence put him on the scene, though the gem was not found on him or in his rooms. The case, which has garnered much attention, has been referred to the Assizes.

So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully,tossing aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is thesequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of agoose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our littledeductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocentaspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose camefrom Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the othercharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves veryseriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played inthis little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, andthese lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If thisfail, I shall have recourse to other methods.” “What will you say?” “Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at thecorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can havethe same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That isclear and concise.” “Very. But will he see it?” “Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, theloss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking thewindow and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight,but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him todrop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to seeit, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are,Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the eveningpapers.” “In which, sir?” “Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St.James’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo,and any others that occur to you.” “Very well, sir. And this stone?” “Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, justbuy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one togive to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is nowdevouring.” When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it againstthe light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see howit glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Everygood stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and olderjewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twentyyears old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and isremarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it isblue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already asinister history.

First, Holmes decides to place an advertisement in major evening newspapers, intended to invite Mr. Baker to collect his lost items at Sherlock's residence.

That, however, Ishall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to ouradvertisement.” “And you can do nothing until then?” “Nothing.” “In that case I shall continue my professional round.

As I approached the house I saw a tallman in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waitingoutside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as Iarrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’room. “Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair andgreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readilyassume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night,and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr.Baker?” “Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.” He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch ofred in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalledHolmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttonedright up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protrudedfrom his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccatofashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of aman of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune. “We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes,“because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving youraddress. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.” Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been soplentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubtthat the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and thebird.

By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eatit.” “To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in hisexcitement. “Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But Ipresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the sameweight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?” “Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh ofrelief. “Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your ownbird, so if you wish—” The man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relicsof my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see whatuse the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions tothe excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.” Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of hisshoulders. “There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “Bythe way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I amsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.” “Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newlygained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent theAlpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself duringthe day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituteda goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we wereeach to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest isfamiliar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fittedneither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of mannerhe bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way. “So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed thedoor behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whateverabout the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?” “Not particularly.” “Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up thisclue while it is still hot.” “By all means.” It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about ourthroats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and thebreath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Ourfootfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street intoOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn,which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runsdown into Holborn.

The club's host, Mr. Windigate, had instituted a policy where everyone would receive a bird for Christmas in return for a few pence every week.

The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one,laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp. “Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought thatI was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is stillone left in my shop. You see this little book?” “Well?” “That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see?Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after theirnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see thisother page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look atthat third name. Just read it out to me.” “Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes. “Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.” Holmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’” “Now, then, what’s the last entry?” “‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s.6d.’” “Quite so. There you are. And underneath?” “‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at12s.’” “What have you to say now?” Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocketand threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whosedisgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post andlaughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him. “When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by abet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front ofhim, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawnfrom him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, Ifancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to bedetermined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, orwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surlyfellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about thematter, and I should—” His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from thestall which we had just left.

If you come pestering me any more withyour silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here andI’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese offyou?” “No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man. “Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.” “She told me to ask you.” “Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve hadenough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and theinquirer flitted away into the darkness. “Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes.“Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.”Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaringstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon theshoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestigeof colour had been driven from his face. “Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quaveringvoice. “You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could nothelp overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I thinkthat I could be of assistance to you.” “You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?” “My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other peopledon’t know.” “But you can know nothing of this?” “Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace somegeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman namedBreckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to hisclub, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.” “Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” criedthe little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I canhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.” Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case wehad better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-sweptmarket-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther,who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.” The man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” heanswered with a sidelong glance. “No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is alwaysawkward doing business with an alias.” A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,”said he, “my real name is James Ryder.” “Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step intothe cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wishto know.” The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened,half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of awindfall or of a catastrophe.

Nothing had been said duringour drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspingsand unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him. “Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.“The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr.Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before wesettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became ofthose geese?” “Yes, sir.” “Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in whichyou were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.” Ryder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can youtell me where it went to?” “It came here.” “Here?” “Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that youshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—thebonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in mymuseum.” Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his righthand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, whichshone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryderstood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it. “The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up,man, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,Watson. He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Givehim a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp itis, to be sure!” For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tingeof colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at hisaccuser. “I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I couldpossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that littlemay as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, ofthis blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?” “It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a cracklingvoice. “I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation ofsudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been forbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain inyou. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in somesuch matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’sroom—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he shouldbe the man sent for.

For Christ’s sake,don’t!” “Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is verywell to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Hornerin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.” “I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the chargeagainst him will break down.” “Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of thenext act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into theopen market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.” Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it justas it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, itseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once,for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their headsto search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would besafe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’shouse.

All the way there every man I met seemed tome to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, thesweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sisterasked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I hadbeen upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yardand smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do. “I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has justbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talkabout the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole.

He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to getto him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming fromthe hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be thestone in my waistcoat pocket.

It’s the big white one overyonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one forus, and two dozen for the market.’ “‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is allthe same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’ “‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she,‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’ “‘Never mind.
