Sherlock Homes,9,1,"['Of all the problemswhich have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solutionduring the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means ofintroducing to his notice—that of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb, and thatof Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded afiner field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange inits inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy ofbeing placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for thosedeductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, likeall such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth enbloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolvebefore your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each newdiscovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the timethe circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two yearshas hardly served to weaken the effect. It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the eventsoccurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practiceand had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although Icontinually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo hisBohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadilyincreased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from PaddingtonStation, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom Ihad cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising myvirtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he mighthave any influence. One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maidtapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and werewaiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experiencethat railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As Idescended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the doortightly behind him. “I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over hisshoulder; “he’s all right.” “What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it wassome strange creature which he had caged up in my room. “It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thoughtI’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There heis, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the sameas you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me timeto thank him. I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He wasquietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he hadlaid down upon my books.

The case, which has been reported in newspapers, had made a deep impression on the narrator and the suspense unfolds gradually with each new revelation.",518

He was young, not more thanfive-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he wasexceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering fromsome strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control. “I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “butI have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train thismorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, aworthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I seethat she has left it upon the side-table.” I took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulicengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style,and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept youwaiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are freshfrom a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonousoccupation.” “Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, andlaughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back inhis chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against thatlaugh. “Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and Ipoured out some water from a caraffe. It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts whichcome upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently hecame to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking. “I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped. “Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, andthe colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks. “That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps youwould kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used tobe.” He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardenednerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horridred, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked ortorn right out from the roots. “Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It musthave bled considerably.” “Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must havebeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was stillbleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist andbraced it up with a twig.” “Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.” “It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my ownprovince.” “This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a veryheavy and sharp instrument.” “A thing like a cleaver,” said he. “An accident, I presume?” “By no means.” “What! a murderous attack?” “Very murderous indeed.” “You horrify me.” I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over withcotton wadding and carbolised bandages.

I wasvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.” “Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently tryingto your nerves.” “Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound ofmine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a veryextraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to backit up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are sovague that it is a question whether justice will be done.” “Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problemwhich you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to myfriend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.” “Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “andI should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I mustuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction tohim?” “I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.” “I should be immensely obliged to you.” “We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to havea little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?” “Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.” “Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in aninstant.” I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, andin five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to BakerStreet. Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in hisdressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking hisbefore-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles leftfrom his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on thecorner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it wasconcluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillowbeneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach. “It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.Hatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourselfabsolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keepup your strength with a little stimulant.” “Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another mansince the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed thecure.

By profession I am a hydraulicengineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the sevenyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, ofGreenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into afair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to startin business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street. “I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business adreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I havehad three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that myprofession has brought me. My gross takings amount to £ 27 10s. Everyday, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in mylittle den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that Ishould never have any practice at all. “Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, myclerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me uponbusiness. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel LysanderStark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, aman rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not thinkthat I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into noseand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstandingbones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to nodisease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. Hewas plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearerforty than thirty. “‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a Germanaccent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a manwho is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capableof preserving a secret.’ “I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address.‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’ “‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you thatjust at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphanand a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’ “‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but youwill excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon myprofessional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matterthat you wished to speak to me?’ “‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is reallyto the point.

I have nowish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. Isuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’ “‘Entirely.’ “‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware thatfuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one ortwo places in England?’ “‘I have heard so.’ “‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a verysmall place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough todiscover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields.On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively smallone, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the rightand left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. Thesegood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which wasquite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy theirland before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capitalby which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however,and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own littledeposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us tobuy the neighbouring fields.

On the otherhand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression uponme, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller’s-earth wassufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extremeanxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears tothe winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, havingobeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue. “At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However,I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-litstation after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got out there,and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with alantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found myacquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Withouta word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which wasstanding open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work,and away we went as fast as the horse could go.” “One horse?” interjected Holmes. “Yes, only one.” “Did you observe the colour?” “Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage.It was a chestnut.” “Tired-looking or fresh?” “Oh, fresh and glossy.” “Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your mostinteresting statement.” “Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour.

The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of theworld, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windowsto see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and Icould make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Nowand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but thecolonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged.

It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, whichshe held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.

It was a quiet,little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on whichseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on thetop of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you waiting aninstant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness. “I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance ofGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others beingvolumes of poetry.

Anexamination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the headof a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which itworked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it outto my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked severalpractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I hadmade it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took agood look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance thatthe story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it wouldbe absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for soinadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of alarge iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust ofmetallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to seeexactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw thecadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me. “‘What are you doing there?’ he asked. “I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as thatwhich he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’said I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to yourmachine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’']",2905,"In the story, the protagonist is led by Colonel Lysander Stark into a small room that is revealed to be the inside of a hydraulic press. Stark warns the protagonist of the danger of accidentally activating the press. It is seen as a huge machine capable of exerting large amounts of pressure, however, it is having technical issues. The protagonist identifies that an india-rubber band has shrunk, causing a leakage of water, and informs his companions on how to fix it. Upon further inspection, the protagonist questions the original explanation given by Stark about the purpose of the machine (purportedly to process fuller's earth), as the machine seems too powerful for such a use. He begins to scrape up a metallic deposit on the floor before Stark interrupts him and the protagonist confesses his doubts about the purpose of the machine.",843

His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes. “‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all aboutthe machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, andturned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, butit was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’ “And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heartinto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leakingcylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floorwhere I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that theblack ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knewbetter than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to ashapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged withmy nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorselessclanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or twoabove my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend verymuch upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight wouldcome upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier theother way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadlyblack shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, whenmy eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart. “I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the wallswere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line ofyellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as asmall panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe thathere was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threwmyself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closedagain behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards theclang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape. “I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I foundmyself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent overme and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right.It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected. “‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They willbe here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste theso-precious time, but come!’ “This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.

My guide stopped and looked about herlike one  who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open a door which ledinto a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly. “‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high,but it may be that you can jump it.’ “As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage,and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with alantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. Irushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet andsweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not bemore than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated tojump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffianwho pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to goback to her assistance.

Were itnot for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadfulhours might have been an evil dream. “Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was onduty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether hehad ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had heobserved a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was therea police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off. “It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to waituntil I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a littlepast six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then thedoctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your handsand shall do exactly what you advise.” We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to thisextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one ofthe ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings. “Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he.“It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, ahydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and hasnot been heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That representsthe last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, Ifancy.” “Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains whatthe girl said.” “Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperateman, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of hislittle game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from acaptured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to itwe shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting forEyford.” Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound fromReading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, thehydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothesman, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out uponthe seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for itscentre. “There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radiusof ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near thatline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.” “It was an hour’s good drive.” “And you think that they brought you back all that way when you wereunconscious?” “They must have done so.

Perhaps thevillain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.” “I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in mylife.” “Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet.“Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point uponit the folk that we are in search of are to be found.” “I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly. “Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed youropinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, forthe country is more deserted there.” “And I say east,” said my patient. “I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There areseveral quiet little villages up there.” “And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hillsthere, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go upany.” “Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a verypretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do yougive your casting vote to?” “You are all wrong.” “But we can’t all be.” “Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in thecentre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.” “But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley. “Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horsewas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gonetwelve miles over heavy roads?” “Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreetthoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of thisgang.” “None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a largescale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the placeof silver.” “We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” saidthe inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they hadcovered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. Butnow, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them rightenough.” But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fallinto the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a giganticcolumn of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in theneighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape. “A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off againon its way. “Yes, sir!” said the station-master. “When did it break out?” “I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and thewhole place is in a blaze.” “Whose house is it?” “Dr. Becher’s.” “Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German,very thin, with a long, sharp nose?” The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an']",2899,"This passage is from a classic Sherlock Holmes mystery.

But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand,who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would dohim no harm.” The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening inthe direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a greatwidespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chinkand window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainlystriving to keep the flames under. “That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.“There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.That second window is the one that I jumped from.” “Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revengeupon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when itwas crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt theywere too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keepyour eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very muchfear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.” And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no wordhas ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or themorose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containingseveral people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction ofReading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and evenHolmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to theirwhereabouts. The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they hadfound within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upona window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were atlast successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof hadfallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, savesome twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinerywhich had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickeland of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to befound, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which havebeen already referred to. How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot wherehe recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not forthe soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carrieddown by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the otherunusually large ones.
