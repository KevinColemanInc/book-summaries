Sherlock Homes,4,1,"['We were seated atbreakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. Itwas from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way: “Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from thewest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad ifyou will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the11:15.” “What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me.“Will you go?” “I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list atpresent.” “Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking alittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you arealways so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ cases.” “I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through oneof them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, forI have only half an hour.” My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of makingme a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in lessthan the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to PaddingtonStation. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gauntfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak andclose-fitting cloth cap. “It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “Itmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I canthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If youwill keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.” We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers whichHolmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervalsof note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenlyrolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack. “Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked. “Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.” “The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just beenlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. Itseems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are soextremely difficult.” “That sounds a little paradoxical.” “But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. Themore featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bringit home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious caseagainst the son of the murdered man.” “It is a murder, then?” “Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted untilI have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the stateof things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very fewwords. “Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, inHerefordshire.

Despite a busy workload, he agrees due to persuasive words from his wife who points out his pallor and interest in Holmes' cases. After efficient packing, he soon meets Holmes at Paddington Station, who expresses gratitude for his company due to his reliability. They travel alone and Holmes fills him in on the case details; a murder in Boscombe Valley in Herefordshire. The main suspect is the son of the murdered man, a prominent landowner in the district. Holmes plans not to make any assumptions until he can investigate personally.",709
Sherlock Homes,4,2,"['who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country.One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. CharlesMcCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in thecolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down theyshould do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richerman, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms ofperfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a ladof eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither ofthem had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of theneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both theMcCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings ofthe neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turnerhad a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much asI have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts. “On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house atHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool,which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs downthe Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning atRoss, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment ofimportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive. “From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman,whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeperin the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy waswalking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way witha gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually insight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of thematter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred. “The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, thegame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round,with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen,Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valleyestate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she wasthere she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthyand his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heardMr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw thelatter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened bytheir violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that']",2940,"Two ex-Australian men, Turner and McCarthy, settle on neighboring farms, Hatherley, in England after making their fortunes in Australia. Turner was wealthier, so McCarthy becomes his tenant. Both men are single fathers to an 18-year-old son and daughter respectively and they keep a low profile. McCarthy one day leaves his house for an appointment and is never seen alive again. Two witnesses, an unnamed old woman and a game-keeper, William Crowder, saw him walking alone, with his son, James McCarthy, following him with a gun. Another witness, a 14-year-old girl, reports seeing the McCarthys in a heated argument with the son appearing to threaten the father physically. The story surrounds the mystery of McCarthy's death.",728

She had hardly said the words when youngMr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his fatherdead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was muchexcited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve wereobserved to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the deadbody stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten inby repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such asmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun,which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under thesecircumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, hewas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred thecase to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came outbefore the coroner and the police-court.” “I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “Ifever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.” “Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmesthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but ifyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in anequally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must beconfessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the youngman, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are severalpeople in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughterof the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who haveretained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study inScarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled,has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen areflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting theirbreakfasts at home.” “I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious thatyou will find little credit to be gained out of this case.” “There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” heanswered, laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some otherobvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You knowme too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirmor destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, oreven of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearlyperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet Iquestion whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing asthat.” “How on earth—” “My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which']",2928,"A woman had witnessed an argument between two McCarthys near Boscombe Pool. Shortly after, the son, McCarthy, rushed to a lodge claiming that his father was dead in the wood, asking for help. He was found to be covered in blood but had no gun or hat. The father's body was found nearby, beaten with a blunt weapon. Evidence suggested that the son's gun, found nearby, could have been the murder weapon, leading to the young McCarthy's arrest. At the inquest, a verdict of wilful murder was returned and he was put in front of the magistrates at Ross. However, some people, including Miss Turner, the daughter of a neighbouring landowner, believe in his innocence and have got a detective, Lestrade, involved. Lestrade, confused by the case, has asked for Holmes's assistance, leading the two men to travel westward to investigate the case. Despite the seemingly damning evidence against the son, Holmes notes that appearances can be deceiving and intends to either confirm or disprove Lestrade's theory using his unique investigation methods.",1042

You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by thesunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get fartherback on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round theangle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminatedthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself inan equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as atrivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my métier,and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigationwhich lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought outin the inquest, and which are worth considering.” “What are they?” “It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after thereturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him thathe was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and thatit was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effectof removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of thecoroner’s jury.” “It was a confession,” I ejaculated. “No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.” “Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least amost suspicious remark.” “On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest riftwhich I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, hecould not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstanceswere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, orfeigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious,because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frankacceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as aman of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about hisdeserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside thedead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very dayso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his handas if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed inhis remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of aguilty one.” I shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighterevidence,” I remarked. “So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.” “What is the young man’s own account of the matter?” “It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though thereare one or two points in it which are suggestive.

The character first notices another's irregular shaving habits, showing their attention to detail and deductive reasoning. They bring up a point about the acceptance of one's arrest, suggesting that a person lacking surprise or indignation might be innocent or very self-controlled. Such acceptance would be suspicious to the observer had the arrested person showed feigned surprise or anger. The possible guilt of the arrested individual is also investigated, considering they were found near their deceased father. The narrator suggests that the person's contrite remarks might be signs of a healthy mind rather than a guilty one. The narrator also mentions that many men may have been wrongfully hung on lesser evidence. The arrested individual's account, however, doesn't seem very encouraging. Yet, there are some interesting points for consideration.",975
Sherlock Homes,4,5,"['having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which theunfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. Isettled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.It ran in this way: “Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called andgave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days atBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed bythe maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortlyafter my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out ofmy window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was notaware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out inthe direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbitwarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, thegame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinkingthat I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. Whenabout a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” whichwas a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, andfound him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing meand asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued whichled to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a veryviolent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left himand returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run backagain. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terriblyinjured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantlyexpired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr.Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask forassistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea howhe came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold andforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. Iknow nothing further of the matter.’ “The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died? “Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion toa rat. “The Coroner: What did you understand by that? “Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me.

I can assure youthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.']",2877,"The summary of the passage is that James McCarthy recounts his experience on the day of his father's tragic death. After a short trip, he returned home and went out with his gun, heard his father's signal, and rushed to find him by the pool. They had an argument which almost ended up in a fight, but James walked away due to his father's violent temper. Shortly after, he heard a dreadful cry and returned to find his father dying of a severe head injury. He declares that he saw no one else around his father and didn't know how his father got his injuries. He also recounts that his father mumbled something about a rat before he died. The coroner presses James about the argument he had with his father before the tragedy, but James insists that it was irrelevant to the incident.",784

I need not point out toyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in anyfuture proceedings which may arise. “Witness: I must still refuse. “The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was acommon signal between you and your father? “Witness: It was. “The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, andbefore he even knew that you had returned from Bristol? “Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know. “A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when youreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured? “Witness: Nothing definite. “The Coroner: What do you mean? “Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vagueimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left ofme. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or aplaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it wasgone. “‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went forhelp?’ “‘Yes, it was gone.’ “  ‘You cannot say what it was?’ “‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’ “‘How far from the body?’ “‘A dozen yards or so.’ “‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’ “‘About the same.’ “‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozenyards of it?’ “‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’ “This concluded the examination of the witness.” “I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that thecoroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. Hecalls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father havingsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of hisconversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’sdying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.” Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushionedseat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he,“to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour.Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too muchimagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause ofquarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolvedfrom his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying referenceto a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth.

In spite of the light browndustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rusticsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engagedfor us. “I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup oftea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy untilyou had been on the scene of the crime.” “It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered.“It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.” Lestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said. “How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in thesky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa isvery much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think thatit is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.” Lestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed yourconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain asa pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, ofcourse, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. Shehas heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told herthat there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why,bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.” He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovelyyoung women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lipsparted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lostin her overpowering excitement and concern. “Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to theother of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening uponmy companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down totell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you tostart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point.We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faultsas no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a chargeis absurd to anyone who really knows him.” “I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes.“You may rely upon my doing all that I can.” “But you have read the evidence.

Do you not yourself think that he isinnocent?” “I think that it is very probable.” “There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and lookingdefiantly at Lestrade. “You hear!

Andabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would notspeak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.” “In what way?” asked Holmes. “It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had manydisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be amarriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother andsister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet,and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like thatyet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.” “And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such aunion?” “No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour ofit.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one ofhis keen, questioning glances at her. “Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see yourfather if I call to-morrow?” “I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.” “The doctor?” “Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for yearsback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr.Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered.

That is important.” “Yes, at the mines.” “Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made hismoney.” “Yes, certainly.” “Thank you, Miss Turner.

Supposing that this unhappy youngman’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, whatabsolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred betweenthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by hisscreams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. Whatcould it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to mymedical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’sdeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone andthe left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from ablunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must havebeen struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, aswhen seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not gofor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blowfell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to it.Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? Itcould not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly becomedelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met hisfate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possibleexplanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. Ifthat were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood toreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with hisback turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries andimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’sopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that Icould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen hisconviction of young McCarthy’s innocence. It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestradewas staying in lodgings in the town. “The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down.“It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to goover the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best andkeenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged bya long journey.

No one knows a word of the matter, but you canimagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what hewould give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the airwhen his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to MissTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and hisfather, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him overutterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spentthe last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Markthat point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for thebarmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to behanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she hasa husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tiebetween them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for allthat he has suffered.” “But if he is innocent, who has done it?” “Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, andthat the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he didnot know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard tocry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those arethe crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk aboutGeorge Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters untilto-morrow.” There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright andcloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, andwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool. “There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “Itis said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despairedof.” “An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes. “About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad,and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a verybad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add,a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farmrent free.”']",2935,"The story revolves around a youth madly in love with Miss Turner. However, two years ago, unknowingly and without the knowledge of anyone else, he married a barmaid in Bristol, making his current love unattainable. The protagonist's father pushes him to propose to Miss Turner, which only torments him more as he cannot fulfill his father's wish due to his secret marriage. He has been staying with his barmaid wife in Bristol, and his father is unaware of his whereabouts. The situation takes a turn when the barmaid abandons him upon learning about his legal troubles. It comes to light that she already has a husband, implying there's no legal bond between her and the protagonist. The protagonist's father is critically ill and it's revealed he is a benefactor of McCarthy, having let him live on Hatherley Farm rent-free.

Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy,who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under suchobligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’sdaughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a verycocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else wouldfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse tothe idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something fromthat?” “We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, withoutflying away after theories and fancies.” “You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it veryhard to tackle the facts.” “Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult toget hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth. “And that is—” “That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that alltheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.” “Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes,laughing. “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm uponthe left.” “Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-lookingbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen uponthe grey walls.

Having measured thesevery carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be ledto the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led toBoscombe Pool. Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Menwho had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would havefailed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawninto two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with asteely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lipscompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. Hisnostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mindwas so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question orremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the trackwhich ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.']",2871,"Holmes and Lestrade discuss the peculiarity of McCarthy, a man of little means, discussing marriage plans for his son with Turner's daughter, an heiress.

They arrive at Hatherley Farm, the crime scene and examine McCarthy's boots from the night of his death and a pair of his son's boots. Holmes is visibly excited during the investigation and is preoccupied with examining the evidence. His intense concentration and eagerness during the chase are emphasized.

Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once hemade quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with theinterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions wasdirected towards a definite end. The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yardsacross, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the privatepark of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the fartherside we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the richlandowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grewvery thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces acrossbetween the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestradeshowed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, somoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been leftby the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager faceand peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampledgrass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned uponmy companion. “What did you go into the pool for?” he asked. “I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon orother trace. But how on earth—” “Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inwardtwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes amongthe reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before theycame like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the partywith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eightfeet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the samefeet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have abetter view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “Theseare young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bearsout his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are thefather’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is thebutt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have wehere? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,they come again—of course that was for the cloak.

For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves anddried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope andexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree asfar as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this alsohe carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wooduntil he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost. “It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked,returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on theright must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to ourluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.” It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross,Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood. “This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out.“The murder was done with it.” “I see no marks.” “There are none.” “How do you know, then?” “The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. Therewas no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with theinjuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.” “And the murderer?” “Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soledshooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, andcarries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications,but these may be enough to aid us in our search.” Lestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headedBritish jury.” “Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work yourown method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shallprobably return to London by the evening train.” “And leave your case unfinished?” “No, finished.” “But the mystery?” “It is solved.” “Who was the criminal, then?” “The gentleman I describe.” “But who is he?” “Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such apopulous neighbourhood.” Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said,“and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for aleft-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock ofScotland Yard.” “All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you thechance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before Ileave.” Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunchupon the table.

One was the fact that hisfather should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeinghim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled severalwords, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Nowfrom this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it bypresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.” “What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?” “Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, asfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot.The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it wasthat he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctlyAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strongpresumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Poolwas someone who had been in Australia.” “What of the rat, then?” Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on thetable. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “Iwired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of themap. “What do you read?” “ARAT,” I read. “And now?” He raised his hand. “BALLARAT.” “Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son onlycaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.So and so, of Ballarat.” “It is wonderful!” I exclaimed. “It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field downconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have comenow out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian fromBallarat with a grey cloak.” “Certainly.” “And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only beapproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardlywander.” “Quite so.” “Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground Igained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to thepersonality of the criminal.” “But how did you gain them?” “You know my method. It is founded upon the observation oftrifles.” “His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of hisstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.” “Yes, they were peculiar boots.” “But his lameness?” “The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left.He put less weight upon it.
