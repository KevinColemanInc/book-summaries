It seems rather sad that his relativesshould allow him to come out alone.” My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pocketsof his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp Februarymorning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground,shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it hadbeen ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side andon the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell.The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerouslyslippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from thedirection of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the singlegentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention. He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive,strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yetrich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cutpearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity ofhis dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional littlesprings, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax uponhis legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, andwrithed his face into the most extraordinary contortions. “What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He islooking up at the numbers of the houses.” “I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands. “Here?” “Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I thinkthat I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, theman, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until thewhole house resounded with the clanging. A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, butwith so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles wereturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his wordsout, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been drivento the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, hebeat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him andtore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down intothe easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him inthe easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ. “You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he.“You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recoveredyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem whichyou may submit to me.” The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his']",2942,"The narrator, presumably Dr. Watson, and Sherlock Holmes observe a man behaving strangely in the streets of London. Though well-dressed, the man is running and gesticulating wildly. Holmes predicts the man is coming to consult him, and sure enough, the man stops at their residence. He appears distressed and beats his head against the wall once he enters their home. Holmes calms him down and assures him that he will help with the man's problem once he has recovered.",469

Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, andturned his face towards us. “No doubt you think me mad?” said he. “I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes. “God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although Iam a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction alsois the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful aform, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. Thevery noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of thishorrible affair.” “Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have aclear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.” “My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar toyour ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.” The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in thesecond largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could havehappened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this mostpitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he bracedhimself to tell his story. “I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why Ihastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure yourco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from thereon foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out ofbreath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and Iwill put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can. “It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful bankingbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investmentsfor our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of ourdepositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shapeof loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in thisdirection during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whomwe have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, orplate. “Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card wasbrought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for itwas that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say nomore than that it was a name which is a household word all over theearth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I wasoverwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but heplunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quicklythrough a disagreeable task. “‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informedthat you are in the habit of advancing money.’']",2897,"A visibly distressed man, Alexander Holder, seeks Sherlock Holmes's help in a matter causing him personal public disgrace and private affliction. Holder, the senior partner in the second largest private banking firm in London, is known for investing in secure loans. He is troubled by a situation involving an important figure in England who approached him for a loan. Holder is desperate to find a solution to the issue, fearing the consequences not just for himself but for his high-profile client too. Holmes advises Holder to calm down and explain his situation more clearly.",579

I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum tentimes over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of businessand to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readilyunderstand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’ “‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ Iasked. “‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall thenmost certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think itright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paidat once.’ “‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley frommy own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain wouldbe rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in thename of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even inyour case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’ “‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raisingup a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘Youhave doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’ “‘One of the most precious public possessions of theempire,’ said I. “‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbeddedin soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which hehad named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he,‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimatewould put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I amprepared to leave it with you as my security.’ “I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexityfrom it to my illustrious client. “‘You doubt its value?’ he asked. “‘Not at all. I only doubt—’ “‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind atrest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certainthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form.Is the security sufficient?’ “‘Ample.’ “‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strongproof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heardof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossipupon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possibleprecaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be causedif any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious asits complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and itwould be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with everyconfidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’ “Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, callingfor my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes. When I was alone']",2931,"The protagonist is approached by a man who requests a loan of £50,000, assuring he will repay it in four days.

The protagonist accepts, and the man entrusts him with the Coronet, stressing that causing any harm to it would result in a major scandal due to its unrivaled worth. The protagonist proceeds to give the man fifty £1000 notes, respecting his need for discretion and immediate payment.",596
Sherlock Homes,11,4,"['once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me,I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility whichit entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a nationalpossession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur toit. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, itwas too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe andturned once more to my work. “When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave soprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forcedbefore now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be theposition in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for thenext few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, sothat it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called acab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I didnot breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau ofmy dressing-room. “And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you tothoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of thehouse, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who havebeen with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite abovesuspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in myservice a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and hasalways given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attractedadmirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawbackwhich we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl inevery way. “So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will nottake me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. Hehas been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. Ihave no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiledhim. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had tolove. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. Ihave never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of ushad I been sterner, but I meant it for the best. “It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business,but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak thetruth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When hewas young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, havingcharming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long pursesand expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander moneyon the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give']",2896,"The narrator is tasked with safeguarding a precious national possession, a responsibility that causes him anxiety given the potential scandal should anything happen to it.

Hetried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he waskeeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, wasenough to draw him back again. “And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwellshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to myhouse, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination ofhis manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, onewho had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man ofgreat personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from theglamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the lookwhich I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quickinsight into character. “And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when mybrother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, andhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in myhouse—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yetas tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I donot know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever goneagainst my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves herdevotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could havedrawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriagemight have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forevertoo late! “Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shallcontinue with my miserable story. “When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner,I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we hadunder our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who hadbrought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear thatthe door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see thefamous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it. “‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur. “‘In my own bureau.’ “‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgledduring the night.’ said he. “‘It is locked up,’ I answered. “‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was ayoungster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’ “He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what hesaid. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face. “‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down,‘can you let me have £ 200?’ “‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have beenfar too generous with you in money matters.’ “‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must']",2937,"The protagonist gave a description of his household, stated his close association with a certain Sir George Burnwell - a charismatic and cynical man, his adopted daughter (his deceased brother's child) whom he greatly values, and his son, Arthur.

But she rejected Arthur’s proposition every time. The protagonist thinks that if she had accepted the proposal, Arthur would have been saved from his current path of self-destruction.

I must raise themoney in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try othermeans.’ “I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowedand left the room without another word. “When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure wassafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that allwas secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought itwell to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herselfat the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached. “‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a littledisturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’ “‘Certainly not.’ “‘She came in just now by the back door.

I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mindtended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning,then, I was awakened by some sound in the house.

Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of thecoronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with ascream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the policeand put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and aconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his armsfolded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. Ianswered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a publicone, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that thelaw should have its way in everything. “‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have mearrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I mightleave the house for five minutes.’ “‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal whatyou have stolen,’ said I.

On the left ran a lane which led to the stables,and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though littleused, thoroughfare.

Farfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London toinquire more deeply into it.” “This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me. “No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in thestable lane now.” “The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can hehope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you willsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur isinnocent of this crime.” “I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may proveit,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from hisshoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. MightI ask you a question or two?” “Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.” “You heard nothing yourself last night?” “Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and Icame down.” “You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten allthe windows?” “Yes.” “Were they all fastened this morning?” “Yes.” “You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to youruncle last night that she had been out to see him?” “Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who mayhave heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.” “I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, andthat the two may have planned the robbery.” “But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried thebanker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with thecoronet in his hands?” “Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?” “Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met herslipping in.

Hisname is Francis Prosper.” “He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—thatis to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?” “Yes, he did.” “And he is a man with a wooden leg?” Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.“Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you knowthat?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’thin, eager face. “I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shallprobably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had bettertake a look at the lower windows before I go up.” He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large onewhich looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a verycareful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Nowwe shall go upstairs,” said he at last. The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with agrey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau firstand looked hard at the lock. “Which key was used to open it?” he asked. “That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of thelumber-room.” “Have you it here?” “That is it on the dressing-table.” Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau. “It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that itdid not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have alook at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid itupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, andthe thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of thecoronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been tornaway. “Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner whichcorresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that youwill break it off.” The banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” saidhe. “Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, butwithout result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but,though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my timeto break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think wouldhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistolshot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed andthat you heard nothing of it?” “I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.” “But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, MissHolder?” “I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.” “Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?” “He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.” “Thank you.

For an hour or more he was atwork, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features asinscrutable as ever. “I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.Holder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to myrooms.” “But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?” “I cannot tell.” The banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” hecried. “And my son?

Good-bye;it is just possible that I may have to come over here again beforeevening.” It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about thecase, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimlyimagine.

His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch ofcolour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later Iheard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more uponhis congenial hunt. I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired tomy room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on endwhen he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise.

I thought I heard a ring.” It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which hadcome over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould,was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shadewhiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painfulthan his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into thearmchair which I pushed forward for him. “I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care inthe world.

I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, andalso that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed alongthe tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down andindistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchendoor, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on oneside showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had beendisturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by thedeep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and thenhad gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and hersweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very longand complex story was written in the snow in front of me. “There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second doubleline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at onceconvinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first hadwalked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked inplaces over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed afterthe other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, whereBoots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end,which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had facedround, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and,finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was notmistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of bloodshowed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at theother end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end tothat clue. “On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the silland framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see thatsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where thewet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to forman opinion as to what had occurred.

Holmes deduces there was a struggle, as indicated by disturbance in the snow, blood spots, and spots where the naked feet had run over the booted footprint. The path leads to a window from which the coronet was likely passed out, and Holmes concludes that Mr. Holder's son had been involved in trying to apprehend the thief during the struggle.",701

Now, I knew that itwas not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and themaids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to beaccused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved hiscousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain hersecret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I rememberedthat you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing thecoronet again, my conjecture became a certainty. “And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for whoelse could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knewthat you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limitedone. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as beinga man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those bootsand retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discoveredhim, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not saya word without compromising his own family. “Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I wentin the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up anacquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the nightbefore, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buyinga pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and sawthat they exactly fitted the tracks.” “I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” saidMr. Holder. “Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home andchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I sawthat a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astutea villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him.At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particularthat had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from thewall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before hecould strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we wouldgive him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought outthe first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ Isoon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising himthat there would be no prosecution.
