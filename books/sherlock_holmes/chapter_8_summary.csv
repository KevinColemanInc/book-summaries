Sherlock Homes,8,1,"['On glancing over mynotes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight yearsstudied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, somecomic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as hedid rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, herefused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towardsthe unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, Icannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which wasassociated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.The events in question occurred in the early days of my association withHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possiblethat I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy wasmade at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month bythe untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps aswell that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know thatthere are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tendto make the matter even more terrible than the truth. It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to findSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a lateriser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it wasonly a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhapsjust a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits. “Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “butit’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, sheretorted upon me, and I on you.” “What is it, then—a fire?” “No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerablestate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in thesitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hourof the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that itis something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove tobe an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from theoutset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you thechance.” “My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.” I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professionalinvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions,and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problemswhich were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in afew minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed inblack and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as weentered. “Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name isSherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before']",2933,"The narrator discusses his experiences with his friend, Sherlock Holmes, and their various investigations together. They tend to cover unusual and strange cases, with Holmes refusing to engage in anything he considers commonplace. One case which stood out involved the Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The secretive details of this case are now being revealed following the death of the lady who had previously required their confidentiality. These revelations could help dispel widespread rumors around the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott. The narrative then transitions to a scene from an April morning when Holmes woke the narrator to address a young lady in an excited state who had arrived at their residence. After a brief conversation, there is implication they would begin a new investigation based on whatever this client has to tell them.",859
Sherlock Homes,8,2,"['whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs.Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and Ishall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you areshivering.” “It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a lowvoice, changing her seat as requested. “What, then?” “It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as shespoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation,her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of somehunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but herhair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances. “You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward andpatting her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.You have come in by train this morning, I see.” “You know me, then?” “No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of yourleft glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in adog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.” The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion. “There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “Theleft arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. Themarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws upmud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of thedriver.” “Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” saidshe. “I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past,and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain nolonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. Ihave heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whomyou helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had youraddress. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at leastthrow a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At presentit is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or sixweeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at leastyou shall not find me ungrateful.” Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, whichhe consulted. “Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it wasconcerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I canonly say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case asI did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward;but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time']",2884,"A distressed woman visits Sherlock Holmes, shivering not from the cold but from fear. Despite looking only thirty, her hair is shot with grey, and her expression is distressed. Sherlock comfortively assures her, showing his observant skills by inferring her journey details from the mud on her jacket.  The woman had heard of Holmes through Mrs. Farintosh, whom he helped in the past. The woman asks Holmes to help her as well, confessing that she is under a lot of strain and fearing for her sanity. She promises to compensate him as soon as she is married in about a month or six weeks and has control of her own income. Holmes agrees to take her case without concern for the payment.",686

And now I beg that you will lay before us everything thatmay help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.” “Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situationlies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend soentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even heto whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon allthat I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so,but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard,Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the humanheart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompassme.” “I am all attention, madam.” “My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is thelast survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts ofStoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.” Holmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he. “The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estatesextended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in thewest. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissoluteand wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by agambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres ofground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under aheavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living thehorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather,seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advancefrom a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out toCalcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, heestablished a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by somerobberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler todeath and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a longterm of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose anddisappointed man. “When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, theyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Juliaand I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of mymother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not lessthan £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely whilewe resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should beallowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return toEngland my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railwayaccident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establishhimself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestralhouse at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our']",2948,"Helen Stoner visits the protagonist, Mr. Holmes, and asks for help against her stepfather, the last surviving member of the ancient Saxon family, Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The family was once very wealthy, but due to the actions of reckless heirs and a gambler, they ended up with a large debt and a heavily mortgaged house. Helen's stepfather, Dr. Roylott, funded his medical studies and established a successful practice in Calcutta. There, he violently killed his butler and served a prison sentence before returning to England. He married Helen's widowed mother, who had a considerable income which she left to him, along with a stipend for Helen and her twin, Julia, in case either married. After their mother died in a train accident, Dr. Roylott moved them into the ancestral family home. The mother's inheritance was enough to support their needs.",854
Sherlock Homes,8,4,"['wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness. “But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Insteadof making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at firstbeen overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, heshut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferociousquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching tomania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in mystepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his longresidence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two ofwhich ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of thevillage, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immensestrength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger. “Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together thatI was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save thewandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon thefew acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and wouldaccept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with themsometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which aresent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and ababoon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagersalmost as much as their master. “You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had nogreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long timewe did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death,and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.” “Your sister is dead, then?” “She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speakto you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, wewere little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however,an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who livesnear Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at thislady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met therea half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learnedof the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to themarriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for thewedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my onlycompanion.” Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and hishead sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across athis visitor. “Pray be precise as to details,” said he. “It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is']",2913,"The narrator details the drastic change in their stepfather's behavior. Once sociable and warm, he became secluded and violent, prone to public brawls and feared by the village due to his immense strength and volatile temper. His only companions were wandering gipsies and dangerous Indian animals, including a cheetah and baboon. As a result of their stepfather's behavior, the narrator and their sister Julia led a harsh, isolated life. Julia, who started greying at 30, met a man during Christmas two years prior and became engaged. However, two weeks before the wedding, a terrible event occurred, resulting in Julia's death.

The bedrooms in this wing are on the groundfloor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of thesebedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, andthe third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open outinto the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?” “Perfectly so.” “The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal nightDr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retiredto rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigarswhich it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came intomine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. Ateleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door andlooked back. “‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heardanyone whistle in the dead of the night?’ “‘Never,’ said I. “‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, inyour sleep?’ “‘Certainly not. But why?’ “‘Because during the last few nights I have always, aboutthree in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and ithas awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the nextroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether youhad heard it.’ “‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in theplantation.’ “‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder thatyou did not hear it also.’ “‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’ “‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her keyturn in the lock.” “Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lockyourselves in at night?” “Always.” “And why?” “I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and ababoon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.” “Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.” “I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortuneimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know howsubtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was awild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating andsplashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, thereburst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was mysister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, andrushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle,such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if amass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door wasunlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.

By the light of the corridor-lampI saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her handsgroping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemedto give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terriblepain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she hadnot recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voicewhich I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! Thespeckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said,and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of theDoctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. Irushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from hisroom in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she wasunconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medicalaid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and diedwithout having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of mybeloved sister.” “One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistleand metallic sound? Could you swear to it?” “That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is mystrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and thecreaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.” “Was your sister dressed?” “No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charredstump of a match, and in her left a match-box.” “Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarmtook place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner cometo?” “He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’sconduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find anysatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastenedupon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutterswith broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefullysounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was alsothoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barredup by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quitealone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence uponher.” “How about poison?” “The doctors examined her for it, but without success.” “What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?” “It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, thoughwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.” “Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?” “Yes, there are nearly always some there.” “Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—aspeckled band?”']",2931,"In the story, a woman named Helen is seen in distress and appearing terrified before falling unconscious. She cryptically states something about a speckled band while pointing towards the room of her doctor. Despite attempts to revive her, Helen dies without regaining consciousness. The cause of death remains mysterious as there was no evidence of violence or poison. Helen's sister believes Helen died of fear and shock, but is uncertain of the cause. Upon questioning from detective Holmes, there's a mention of a speckled band, gypsies who often occupy the property and noises that were heard, but their significance remains unknown.",638

I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefswhich so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strangeadjective which she used.” Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied. “These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with yournarrative.” “Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until latelylonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known formany years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name isArmitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of CraneWater, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, andwe are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairswere started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has beenpierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died,and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill ofterror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, Isuddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been theherald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to beseen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed,and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn,which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on thismorning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.” “You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told meall?” “Yes, all.” “Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.” “Why, what do you mean?” For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the handthat lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks offour fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist. “You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes. The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is ahard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his ownstrength.” There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his handsand stared into the crackling fire. “This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are athousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our courseof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moranto-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without theknowledge of your stepfather?” “As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some mostimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that therewould be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old andfoolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”']",2937,"The speaker, Miss Roylott, narrates her story to Holmes, about her engagement to Percy Armitage after being lonely for two years since her sister's unexplained death.

She talks about moving into her sister's room due to repairs in her wing of the house and having heard the same whistle, which was heard during her sister's death, leaving her terrified. Miss Roylott has come to consult Holmes for advice but he accuses her of protecting her stepfather.

I have myself some smallbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?” “No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided mytrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.”She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room. “And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,leaning back in his chair. “It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.” “Dark enough and sinister enough.” “Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls aresound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sistermust have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.” “What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the verypeculiar words of the dying woman?” “I cannot think.” “When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a bandof gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that wehave every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing hisstepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, thefact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have beencaused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back intoits place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may becleared along those lines.” “But what, then, did the gipsies do?” “I cannot imagine.” “I see many objections to any such theory.” “And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to StokeMoran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they maybe explained away.

His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of theagricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of highgaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hatactually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to spanit across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles,burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned fromone to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey. “Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition. “My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companionquietly.']",2920,"Sherlock Holmes and Watson are discussing a mysterious case involving the death of a woman who was seemingly alone at the time.

You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a stepforward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I haveheard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.” My friend smiled. “Holmes, the busybody!” His smile broadened. “Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!” Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decideddraught.” “I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with myaffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerousman to fall foul of!

He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notesand figures. “I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “Todetermine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present pricesof the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at thetime of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through thefall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can claim anincome of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if bothgirls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even oneof them would cripple him to a very serious extent.

Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointedover the meadows. “Look there!” said he. A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a groveat the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gablesand high roof-tree of a very old mansion. “Stoke Moran?” said he. “Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked thedriver. “There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “thatis where we are going.” “There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a clusterof roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house,you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpathover the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.” “And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shadinghis eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.” We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead. “I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile,“that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on somedefinite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You seethat we have been as good as our word.” Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face whichspoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried,shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylotthas gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back beforeevening.” “We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’sacquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what hadoccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened. “Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.” “So it appears.” “He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will hesay when he returns?” “He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more']",2922,"The narrator and Holmes prepare to go to Waterloo with the essentials - a toothbrush and revolver.

Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at onceto the rooms which we are to examine.” The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portionand two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. Inone of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards,while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion wasin little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, andthe blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys,showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had beenerected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, butthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walkedslowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention theoutsides of the windows. “This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, thecentre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr.Roylott’s chamber?” “Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.” “Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does notseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.” “There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from myroom.” “Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runsthe corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, ofcourse?” “Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.” “As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachablefrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and baryour shutters?” Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the openwindow, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but withoutsuccess. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise thebar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron,built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratchinghis chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents somedifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, weshall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.” A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the threebedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed atonce to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in whichher sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a lowceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.

The boards round and thepanelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discolouredthat it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew oneof the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round andround and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment. “Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointingto a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lyingupon the pillow. “It goes to the housekeeper’s room.” “It looks newer than the other things?” “Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.” “Your sister asked for it, I suppose?” “No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wantedfor ourselves.” “Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You willexcuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” Hethrew himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftlybackward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then hedid the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally hewalked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running hiseye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave ita brisk tug. “Why, it’s a dummy,” said he. “Won’t it ring?” “No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You cansee now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening forthe ventilator is.” “How very absurd! I never noticed that before.” “Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “Thereare one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool abuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the sametrouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!” “That is also quite modern,” said the lady. “Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes. “Yes, there were several little changes carried out about thattime.” “They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummybell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, MissStoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.” Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter,but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books,mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain woodenchair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principalthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and allof them with the keenest interest. “What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe. “My stepfather’s business papers.” “Oh! you have seen inside, then?”']",2873,"The detective, Holmes, meticulously examines a room with a considerable amount of old oak furniture and a bell rope next to the bed, which is not connected to anything. The rope, placed a couple of years earlier, is connected to a hook above the ventilator– also a recent addition. Holmes criticizes the builder for creating a ventilator that opens into another room rather than outside. He later examines the stepdaughter's chambers, as plain as the other room, and discovers a safe containing the stepfather's business papers. The unique aspects of the room, including the dummy bell-rope and non-ventilating ventilator, arouse his curiosity as he continues his investigation.",678

I remember that it was full of papers.” “There isn’t a cat in it, for example?” “No. What a strange idea!” “Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stoodon the top of it. “No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and ababoon.” “Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucerof milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is onepoint which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down in front of thewooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention. “Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting hislens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!” The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner ofthe bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make aloop of whipcord. “What do you make of that, Watson?” “It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should betied.” “That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I thinkthat I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shallwalk out upon the lawn.” I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it waswhen we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked severaltimes up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break inupon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie. “It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that youshould absolutely follow my advice in every respect.” “I shall most certainly do so.” “The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend uponyour compliance.” “I assure you that I am in your hands.” “In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in yourroom.” Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment. “Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the villageinn over there?” “Yes, that is the Crown.” “Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?” “Certainly.” “You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, whenyour stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, youmust open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as asignal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely towant into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite ofthe repairs, you could manage there for one night.” “Oh, yes, easily.” “The rest you will leave in our hands.” “But what will you do?” “We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate thecause of this noise which has disturbed you.” “I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,”said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve. “Perhaps I have.”']",2897,"In this narrative, a mysterious situation involving a milk saucer and a chair examination is presented.

I think that there was probably some moretangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylottreturned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, forif you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soondrive away the dangers that threaten you.” Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-roomat the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we couldcommand a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke MoranManor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge formlooming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had someslight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roarof the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinchedfists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden lightspring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms. “Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in thegathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking youto-night. There is a distinct element of danger.” “Can I be of assistance?” “Your presence might be invaluable.” “Then I shall certainly come.” “It is very kind of you.” “You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms thanwas visible to me.” “No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine thatyou saw all that I did.” “I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that couldanswer I confess is more than I can imagine.” “You saw the ventilator, too?” “Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have asmall opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly passthrough.” “I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to StokeMoran.” “My dear Holmes!” “Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sistercould smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at oncethat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be asmall one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry.I deduced a ventilator.” “But what harm can there be in that?” “Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator ismade, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.

We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.” “Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is thefirst of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchardwere among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but Ithink, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall havehorrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have aquiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something morecheerful.” About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and allwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, andthen, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone outright in front of us. “That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “itcomes from the middle window.” As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that wewere going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that wemight spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, achill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of usthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand. There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breachesgaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached thelawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from aclump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distortedchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftlyacross the lawn into the darkness. “My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?” Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon mywrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to myear. “It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is thebaboon.” I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was acheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. Iconfess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. Mycompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, andcast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Thencreeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my earagain so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words: “The least sound would be fatal to our plans.” I nodded to show that I had heard. “We must sit without light.

I will sit on the side of the bed, and you inthat chair.” I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table. Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed besidehim. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turneddown the lamp, and we were left in darkness. How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not eventhe drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, withina few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolutedarkness. From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our verywindow a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed atliberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, whichboomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters!Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently forwhatever might befall. Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of theventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell ofburning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, thoughthe smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Thensuddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, likethat of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instantthat we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashedfuriously with his cane at the bell-pull. “You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?” But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low,clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made itimpossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. Icould, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror andloathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator whensuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry towhich I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell ofpain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say thataway down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raisedthe sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazingat Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into thesilence from which it rose. “What can it mean?” I gasped. “It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “Andperhaps, after all, it is for the best.

Then he turned thehandle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand. It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lanternwith the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the ironsafe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, satDr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare anklesprotruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticedduring the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in adreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had apeculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightlyround his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion. “The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes. I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, andthere reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head andpuffed neck of a loathsome serpent. “It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake inIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs foranother. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then removeMiss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what hashappened.” As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, andthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horridperch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,which he closed upon it. Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run totoo great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl,how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt atHarrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion thatthe doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. Thelittle which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes aswe travelled back next day. “I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusionwhich shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason frominsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain theappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match,were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.

Sherlock Homes,8,18,"['to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not comeeither from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I havealready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hungdown to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed wasclamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope wasthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with myknowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India,I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form ofpoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was justsuch a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Easterntraining. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also,from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would showwhere the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Ofcourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to thevictim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, toreturn to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at thehour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the ropeand land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she mightescape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim. “I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. Aninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing onit, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach theventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcordwere enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallicclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastilyclosing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up mymind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantlylit the light and attacked it.” “With the result of driving it through the ventilator.” “And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at theother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakishtemper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubtindirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot saythat it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”']",2730,"The narrator believes that the danger threatening an occupant of a room comes from a snake sent from a ventilator connected by a bell-rope to the bed. He thinks the snake is a tool of murder, leaving only two small, inconspicuous punctures, and the poison it injects cannot be traced by chemical tests. The owner of the snake is believed to be a doctor with an Eastern training supplied with creatures from India and can summon the snake back by a whistle. The snake likely lives in a safe and drinks milk. The narrator had confirmed his theories before entering the culprit's room, which helped him face the danger. When he lit a light and attacked the snake, it retreated into the ventilator and attacked its master, indirectly causing his death. The narrator doesn't feel guilty about this outcome.",801
