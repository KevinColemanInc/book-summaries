Sherlock Homes,2,1,"['I hadcalled upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last yearand found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderlygentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about towithdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the doorbehind me. “You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dearWatson,” he said cordially. “I was afraid that you were engaged.” “So I am. Very much so.” “Then I can wait in the next room.” “Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helperin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of theutmost use to me in yours also.” The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with aquick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes. “Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair andputting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.“I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarreand outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You haveshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle,and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my ownlittle adventures.” “Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” Iobserved. “You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we wentinto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that forstrange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, whichis always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.” “A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.” “You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, forotherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaksdown under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here hasbeen good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative whichpromises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time.You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are veryoften connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, andoccasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crimehas been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to saywhether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course ofevents is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence yournarrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard theopening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxiousto have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard someslight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the']",2913,"The narrator, Watson, visits his friend Sherlock Holmes and finds him with a stout, red-haired man named Mr. Wilson. Despite Watson's initial intention to leave, Holmes insists that he stay as Wilson has been a useful partner in his past cases. Holmes asserts his belief that everyday life is far more intriguing than imagination. He refers to the case of Mr. Wilson as a particularly unique story and suggests that it may be related to a minor crime. Holmes then asks Wilson to recount his story, in part for Watson's benefit, but also due to his own interest in understanding every detail of an unusual case.",610
Sherlock Homes,2,2,"['thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the presentinstance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief,unique.” The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little prideand pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of hisgreatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrustforward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at theman and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indicationswhich might be presented by his dress or appearance. I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore everymark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, andslow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a notover-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat witha heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down asan ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvetcollar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there wasnothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expressionof extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features. Sherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his headwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obviousfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that heis a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerableamount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.” Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper,but his eyes upon my companion. “How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I didmanual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’scarpenter.” “Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger thanyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.” “Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?” “I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use anarc-and-compass breastpin.” “Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?” “What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for fiveinches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest itupon the desk?” “Well, but China?” “The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist couldonly have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks andhave even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of stainingthe fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When,in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matterbecomes even more simple.”']",2886,"Sherlock Holmes amazes a portly, unremarkable visitor with his deduction skills. The visitor, Mr. Jabez Wilson, is visibly impressed as Holmes conjectures, from just his appearance, that he had been a manual labourer, used snuff, was a freemason, had been to China, and had done a lot of writing recently. When questioned about how he figured all this out, Holmes explains his observations such as the size difference in his hands, wear on his cuffs, a particular tattoo only found in China, and a freemason symbol in view.",523
Sherlock Homes,2,3,"['becomes even more simple.” Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he.“I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see thatthere was nothing in it after all.” “I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make amistake in explaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ youknow, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if Iam so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?” “Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red fingerplanted halfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all.You just read it for yourself, sir.” I took the paper from him and read as follows: “TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late EzekiahHopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy openwhich entitles a member of the League to a salary of £ 4 a week for purelynominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and abovethe age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleveno’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope’sCourt, Fleet Street.” “What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice readover the extraordinary announcement. Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in highspirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?”said he. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us allabout yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement hadupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and thedate.” “It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two monthsago.” “Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?” “Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a smallpawnbroker’s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not avery large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me aliving. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; andI would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages soas to learn the business.” “What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes. “His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either.It’s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what Iam able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideasin his head?” “Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé whocomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience amongemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not asremarkable as your advertisement.” “Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never wassuch a fellow for photography.

Wilson shares an advertisement he came across for a job exclusively for red-headed men paying a salary of £4 a week for nominal services. The address leads to the Red-Headed League's offices. Confused, Holmes asks Mr. Wilson to share more personal details about himself, his business, and how the ad has impacted him. Wilson reveals he runs a pawnbroker's business and has an assistant named Vincent Spaulding who worked for half the usual wages. Holmes finds the assistant as fascinating as the ad, suggesting that low-wage workers are rare in their time. The conversation reveals that Spaulding has a strong interest in photography.",737

There’s no vice in him.” “He is still with you, I presume?” “Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cookingand keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I ama widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us;and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more. “The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, hecame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper inhis hand, and he says: “‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headedman.’ “‘Why that?’ I asks. “‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy onthe League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune toany man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than thereare men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with themoney. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib allready for me to step into.’ “‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes,I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of myhaving to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over thedoor-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,and I was always glad of a bit of news. “‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headedMen?’ he asked with his eyes open. “‘Never.’ “‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself forone of the vacancies.’ “‘And what are they worth?’ I asked. “‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work isslight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s otheroccupations.’ “Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for thebusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundredwould have been very handy. “‘Tell me all about it,’ said I. “‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement,‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is theaddress where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, theLeague was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was verypeculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathyfor all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left hisenormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply theinterest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’ “‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions ofred-headed men who would apply.’ “‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered.‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. ThisAmerican had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old']",2911,"The passage discusses a man named Spaulding, who works for a quiet, widowed man named Mr. Wilson. Spaulding is described as an avid photographer and his only fault lies in his inclination to disappear into his cellar to develop his photos. The household also includes a 14-year-old girl assisting with simple cooking and cleaning chores. Spaulding reveals about an advertisement for the 'League of the Red-headed Men' to Mr. Wilson. It is a peculiar setup that awards a considerably profitable position to red-headed men, established by an eccentric, deceased American millionaire who had a fascination for people sharing his red-hair trait. Mr Wilson shows interest in the opportunity as he could use the extra fortune, considering the state of his business. As Mr. Wilson understands, the opportunity only caters to grown, red-headed men from London.",852

Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; butperhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way forthe sake of a few hundred pounds.’ “Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that myhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there wasto be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that Ihad ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thoughthe might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the dayand to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so weshut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in theadvertisement. “I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north,south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had trampedinto the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked withred-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orangebarrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country aswere brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour theywere—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, asSpaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint.When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; butSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but hepushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up tothe steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair,some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as wellas we could and soon found ourselves in the office.” “Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmesas his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.“Pray continue your very interesting statement.” “There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a dealtable, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managedto find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy didnot seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn camethe little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and heclosed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us. “‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant,‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’ “‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the otheranswered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seenanything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side,']",2926,"The story is about a man named Mr. Wilson who is interested in applying for a position that specifically required people with bright red hair. Mr. Wilson believes he stands a good chance due to his vivid red hair, so with the help of his assistant, Vincent Spaulding, he decides to apply. Upon reaching the advertised address, Wilson is stunned to find a swarm of red-haired men who have also come to apply. After finally making it to the office, Wilson meets a man with even redder hair who dismisses most candidates due to certain faults. However, when Wilson's turn comes, the man is very impressed with him and deems him well-suited for the job in the 'League'.",665

Then suddenly he plungedforward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success. “‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he.‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obviousprecaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tuggeduntil I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ saidhe as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But wehave to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you withhuman nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it atthe top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointmentcame up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions untilthere was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager. “‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and Iam myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Areyou a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’ “I answered that I had not. “His face fell immediately. “‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is veryserious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, forthe propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’ “My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not tohave the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes hesaid that it would be all right. “‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘theobjection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man withsuch a head of hair as yours.

Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer meup, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.

October 9, 1890.” Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful facebehind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped everyother consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter. “I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothingbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.” “No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from whichhe had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world.It is most refreshingly unusual.

Come along!” We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took usto Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened toin the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four linesof dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure,where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hardfight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and abrown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a cornerhouse, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked itall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walkedslowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenlyat the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, havingthumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he wentup to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in. “Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how youwould go from here to the Strand.” “Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly,closing the door. “Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “Heis, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am notsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of himbefore.” “Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts fora good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that youinquired your way merely in order that you might see him.” “Not him.” “What then?” “The knees of his trousers.” “And what did you see?” “What I expected to see.” “Why did you beat the pavement?” “My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We arespies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Letus now explore the parts which lie behind it.” The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from theretired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front ofa picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed thetraffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with theimmense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, whilethe footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It wasdifficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and statelybusiness premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded andstagnant square which we had just quitted. “Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancingalong the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses']",2936,"The protagonist and his companion travel to Saxe-Coburg Square, which was the place involved in the peculiar story they had heard in the morning.

The protagonist examines the place meticulously and then questions Wilson's assistant about the route to the Strand. The assistant's prompt response impresses the protagonist.

All the afternoon he sat in thestalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thinfingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid,dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes therelentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible toconceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserteditself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have oftenthought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood whichoccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extremelanguor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so trulyformidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amidhis improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust ofthe chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning powerwould rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted withhis methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not thatof other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music atSt. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whomhe had set himself to hunt down. “You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged. “Yes, it would be as well.” “And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This businessat Coburg Square is serious.” “Why serious?” “A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believethat we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rathercomplicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.” “At what time?” “Ten will be early enough.” “I shall be at Baker Street at ten.” “Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, sokindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turnedon his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd. I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressedwith a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.

Finally, the day ends with Holmes inviting the Doctor for a secret investigation in the evening at Baker Street, hinting at a possible crime scenario and advising him to carry his revolver for safety.

As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all,from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of theEncyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominouswords with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, andwhy should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had thehint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was aformidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle itout, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night shouldbring an explanation. It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across thePark, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standingat the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices fromabove. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with twomen, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, whilethe other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat andoppressively respectable frock-coat. “Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up hispea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, Ithink you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.” “We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jonesin his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man forstarting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the runningdown.” “I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily. “You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” saidthe police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, ifhe won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say thatonce or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure,he has been more nearly correct than the official force.” “Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the strangerwith deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the firstSaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.” “I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you willplay for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the playwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay yourhands.” “John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.

Sherlock Holmes then reveals that they are after John Clay, a notorious criminal, and that the stakes are high: £30,000 for Mr. Merryweather and the capture of the elusive Clay for Jones.

I’ve been on his trackfor years and have never set eyes on him yet.” “I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.I’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agreewith you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, andquite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and Iwill follow in the second.” Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay backin the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattledthrough an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged intoFarrington Street. “We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellowMerryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. Ithought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, thoughan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is asbrave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws uponanyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.” We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves inthe morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr.Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which heopened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massiveiron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps,which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to lighta lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so,after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled allround with crates and massive boxes. “You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as heheld up the lantern and gazed about him. “Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick uponthe flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quitehollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise. “I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmesseverely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of ourexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon oneof those boxes, and not to interfere?” The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injuredexpression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and,with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracksbetween the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to hisfeet again and put his glass in his pocket. “We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they']",2900,"Sherlock Holmes and his team are out to capture a cunning and elusive mastermind, John Clay.

Then theywill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time theywill have for their escape.

Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he willexplain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of Londonshould take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.” “It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have hadseveral warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.” “Your French gold?” “Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources andborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It hasbecome known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that itis still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is muchlarger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and thedirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.” “Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And nowit is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hourmatters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put thescreen over that dark lantern.” “And sit in the dark?” “I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and Ithought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubberafter all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far thatwe cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose ourpositions.

The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light wasstill there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice.

My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared tochange my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch oftension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentlebreathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavierin-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light. At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthenedout until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, agash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, whichfelt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more thehand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it waswithdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the singlelurid spark which marked a chink between the stones. Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound,one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square,gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge therepeeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with ahand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high,until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side ofthe hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself,with a pale face and a shock of very red hair. “It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chiseland the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing forit!” Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The otherdived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutchedat his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, butHolmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistolclinked upon the stone floor. “It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “Youhave no chance at all.” “So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “Ifancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got hiscoat-tails.” “There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes. “Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I mustcompliment you.” “And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was verynew and effective.” “You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones.“He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out whileI fix the derbies.” “I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarkedour prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not beaware that I have royal blood in my veins.

He made a sweeping bowto the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective. “Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed themfrom the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most completemanner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever comewithin my experience.” “I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. JohnClay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over thismatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amplyrepaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearingthe very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.” “You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morningas we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it wasperfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this ratherfantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of theEncyclopædia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of theway for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubtsuggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of hisaccomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, andwhat was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in theadvertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites theman to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence everymorning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having comefor half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive forsecuring the situation.” “But how could you guess what the motive was?” “Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgarintrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business wasa small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for suchelaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at.

Saturdaywould suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days fortheir escape.
